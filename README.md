# ecobricks-org
The Global Ecobrick Alliance is proud to have fully hand coded the full stack of our flagship ecobricks.org site in order to fully embody our regenerative principles in our code.

This is the repository for the PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript that make up the Ecobricks.org home page.  From this repository we launch daily updates of the site.  

Help us to make it better by assisting with the translation, coding, proof reading, and content development of the page.

Note that as of March 2025, we're making a major shift in the organization of our code, and have thus forked this repository for our live ecobricks.org page and beta.ecobricks.org page where we are implimenting the changes.
