Fact is, it's incredibly unique and valuable— you literally can't find anything like it in elsewhere in our solar system! Plastic is a petroleum by-product. That means it is made from the carbon of ancient organisms— algae, forest, dinosaurs that lived and died hundreds of millions of years ago. As their bodies were buried, the Earth compacted and secured their carbon underground. Over time, this process of carbon sequestration removed more and more carbon from the atmosphere and greened the biosphere. Today, we dig up these deposits as 'fossil fuels'. But, this ancient carbon was never meant to be fuel! Refining fossil fuels leads to lots of leftover chemicals— which are perfect for making plastic and dangerous when let loose into the environment.",

    "074-plastic-concern-description": "Your plastic represents an incredible opportunity! With your everyday plastic you can make tiny ripples that over time will turn into giant waves of ecological enrichment. Plastic is the tip of the iceberg of a massive system powered by the extraction and burning of ancient carbon deposits. As this carbon gets loose in the atmosphere and oceans, it adversely affects the biosphere. While no one wants to see a rich ecosystem deplete or an animal suffer, unfortunately, there is a direct correlation between the plastic that we consume today and these consequences tomorrow. Small adjustments in our relationship with plastic can thus point us out of the petro-capital system. Small choices today can reduce the system's momentum into the future and compounds into great greening consequences: the acceleration of a whole different kind of system with a lot less plastic and a lot richer ecosystems.",

However, there's no more powerful way to manifest change than by living it first ourselves. As a product of both the Earth and the petro-capital economy, plastic is the ultimate representation of the old Way we've been relating to the Earth. By changing the way we see plastic and what we do with it, we can shift our attitude from worry and despair to love and care. By loving and caring for our plastic, we can begin to heal the roots of our relationship with it and the Earth: The very same roots that all the other big issues happen to share.",

When organisms consume these 'micro-plastics' their digestion gets clogged up and they get sick. Many die.

    "094-why-make-ecobricks-description": "Plastic is part of our petro-capital age. No matter your culture or continent, you're going to be consuming some plastic! Unlike other plastic management methods, ecobricking allows us to be 100% sure our plastic doesn't get into the biosphere or cause more factories to spin. Because ecobricking is hard work, it motivates us to consume less. If you've made an ecobrick, you know that having to pack one's consumption piece by piece, gets one thinking about the whole system behind our plastic! And since we're not putting it back in the system, we can be confident lots more carbon and plastic aren't produced. Finally, since building with ecobricks is a hands-on, collaboration powered process, it brings us together with friends and family to make great green spaces that serve our communities. As far as we know, there's nothing better one can do with the plastic that we've got now— and the fastest way to speed up our transition from it.",

For your first ecobrick, start with a small, clear PET bottle that is common in your community. Make sure you've got a solid stick (dowel, drumstick, branch, <a href=\"/earthwand\">earthwand</a> etc.). Start by inserting a soft, colored plastic down to the bottom of the bottle. Stuff it down with other plastics of the same color until you have a 2-3cm base. Cut up other kinds of plastics and insert them loosely into the bottle until it is almost full. Use your stick to pack the plastics down by pushing around on the sides. Fill, pack, repeat and repeat! Leave 1-2cm of space at the top of the bottle. Cap. Then, weigh your ecobrick. Make sure your ecobrick's density is over the GEA's recommended minimum 0.33g/ml (divide weight by the bottle's volume to get the density). Good ecobricks are above 0.4g/ml. Log your ecobrick (keep a list, spreadsheet or use our handy <a href=\"https://gobrik.com\" target=\"_blank\">GoBrik.com app</a>). Store securely.

The more plastic is exposed, the more plastic degrades— releasing CO2, other greenhouse gases, and toxins. Eventually, plastic breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces called micro-plastics. Increasingly, scientists are realizing that these toxins and micro-plastic infiltrate ecosystems causing problems for plants and animals. Eventually, plastic's molecules reach us and our children where they adversely impact human metabolisms. Because of this, it's important to not let our plastic get loose into the biosphere by littering or dumping it.",

    "119-burning-content1": "Whether plastic is burned on the side of the road or in a high-tech waste-to-energy plant, it is a momentous tragedy. The carbon that composes our modern plastic is the result of hundreds of millions of years of work by the Earth to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Through the Earth's gradual subtraction of this carbon underground, the Earth's climate stabilized and the biosphere greened. When plastic is burned, in an instant, millions of years of Earthen process are reversed. Plastic's carbon is dispersed and released back into the atmosphere, while poisonous and toxic chemicals are often created through the combustion.",
    "120-burning-content2": "Worse, incinerating plastic also encourages more new plastic to be made, more ancient carbon to be extraction, and yet more incineration. Because it seems so easy to dispose of plastic by burning it, it makes it seem like there's no problem using plastic in the first place.

Unfortunately, when recycling is done <i>for-profit</i> rather than <i>for-Earth</i>, it does not achieve the green effects we hope for. In fact, the very opposite. Industrial recycling tends to downcycle plastic into lower and lower grades that have less and less likelihood of being recycled. Eventually, the utility value of the old plastic is exhausted and no more profit can be made. This plastic then ends up <a href=\"#dump\">dumping</a> or <a href=\"#burning\">burned</a>— causing the ecological issues mentioned in the answers above. It's also important to remember that industrial recycle is hardly ever local. Plastic must be transported, melted, molded, repackaged and transported again— often between stores and far-away factories. This requires fuel, energy and releases further carbon into the biosphere.",
    "126-recycled-content2": "Most significantly, recycling plastic leads to more and more products made from plastic. Precisely because recycling seems to be a solution, it encourages us to keep consuming things made from plastic. And those new products made with old plastic?

Rather than cycling plastic only a few times, ecobriking creates indefinitely reusable building blocks. Rather than rely on marketing that lowers ecological awareness, ecobricking is a hands-on learning experience that raises it. Rather than result in more products and factories that harm plants and animals, ecobricking leads to green spaces that give them a home.

In fact, ecobrick and earth building for outdoor green spaces (our recommended ecobrick application) reduces flammability to virtually nil by completely encasing ecobricks in cob.

By ecobricking our carbon/plastic we're getting out of 'final' thinking and back to following the example of the Earth. Ecobricks are designed to both secure their carbon/plastic and to be local building blocks— just like in ecosystems! In the same way the Earth gifted us densely packed carbon (i.e., fossil fuels), we can gift our carbon to others in the future. Like the dinosaurs, we can't imagine how our plastic/carbon will be used in the future.

Instead of connecting to content on a server on the other side of the planet, the content can be served by the computer nearest you.  This saves time and energy and is a valuable service that websites pay for.  By directing the service payments of the CDN clients through the Ecobricks.org manual blockchain, dollars, kilobytes, and kilograms of plastic can directly be correlated.  Your visit to arc websites results in AES plastic offset credits purchased and the valuation of the removal of plastic from the biosphere by ecobrickers around the world.",
