    "002-splash-subtitle": "Guide your packaging into a greening spiral of life cycles",
    "003-splash-image-alt": "<img src=\"../icons/ecobrickable-icon-from-ecobricks-org-white.svg?v=1\" style=\"width: 70%\" alt=\"Brikable designator icon\">",

    
    "004-lead-paragraph": "The Brickable Designator Icon can be placed on single-use plastics to designate its next life as an ecobrick. Our free Kit contains everything you need to mark your packaging as brickable and take your first step into spiral design.",
    "005-page-paragraph-1": "Transitioning from plastic is not easy. Try as we might, in our day and age, regulations and markets demand the use of plastic for just about everything. However, plastic in-itself is not the problem. Rather, it is our poor design and planning. In particular: <i>the failure to designate a next-life for our plastic creations</i> that avoids the perils of promoting yet more plastic consumption and yet more industrial plastic production and processing.",
    "006-page-paragraph-2": "Designing a product as spiral is the first and essential step in an enterprise’s plastic transition. Phasing it out entirely is the second. Ecobrickable Designation enables companies to start their <a href=\"transition.php\">plastic transition today</a>.",

    "008-earthen-design-subtitle": "The context and call for spiral design.",
    "009-reg-content-paragraph-1": "For many companies making the transition to regenerative products is daunting. It appears to require large investments in manufacturing, materials, systems, and certifications. Furthermore, it may seem that alternative organic materials do not yet meet health and safety standards and are not yet cost-effective.",
    "010-reg-content-paragraph-2": "As a transition-step, plastic products and packaging can be made brickable!",
    "011-reg-content-paragraph-3": "Designing a product as ecobrickable— and clearly designating it as so— is a first step into earthen spiral design. By designating a product or package as ecobrickable we can keep plastic out of industrial recycling and incineration that cause more problems than they create. Encouraging the use of plastic to make it an ecobrick shows the way to the plastic's next life and purpose as a reusable building block.",
    "012-reg-content-paragraph-4": "Ecobricks and their applications are themselves fully spiral and based on <a href=\"principles.php\">regenerative principles</a>, enabling the plastic's indefinite and localized reuse towards long-term <a href=\"sequest.php\">sequestration.</a> Both the Brickable Designator Icon and ecobricking are based on following the Earth's example of carbon care and the ethics of ecological contribution.",
