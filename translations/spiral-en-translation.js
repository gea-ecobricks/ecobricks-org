    "005-page-paragraph": 'One of the several core<a href="principles.php"> ecobricking principles</a> is that of <i>spiral design</i>.  Unlike linear and circular design, rather than plan in lines and circles, we plan in spirals.  This way, we can embed an enriching spin of short and long-term reuse into the way we put our ecobricks to use.',

    "008-lead-panel-paragraph": "Today, the vast majority of the products we use go from their birth in a factory, into our hands, to their grave. Pollution is the result.  Designs that fail to anticipate and plan for the end of a product are known as \"cradle-to-grave\".",
    "009-first-detail-paragraph": "Unfortunately, products and materials that are designed to be 'circular' also lead to pollution and ecological depletion.  Although, \"cradle-to-cradle\" designs that can be used over are a step in the right direction, if the external impacts of each cycle aren't considered carefully (for example the making and fueling of the factory that makes a product), a spiral of depletion will result.  Alas, we see this all too clearly with traditional industrial recycling:  each time a piece of plastic is recycled, large amounts of emission-intensive transportation, sorting, smelting are required.",

Spiral design is why: we‚Äôre thinking of the ecobrick's next phase when we‚Äôll build with it. This is also why we use cob or silicone when we attach ecobricks to make modules and not glue or cement.  The first materials form a non-permanent bond, while the second are permanent.  This way, when our creation comes to its end, we can take it apart and use the ecobricks again.",
