    "010-ecobrick-definition": "<b>Ecobrick</b>",
    "011-ecobrick-spelling": '<b>"ecobrick"</b> — no space, hyphen or added capitalization is the recognized spelling.  This is the recognized spelling of the ecobrick’s Wikipedia entry and URL: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecobricks" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/ecobricks.</a>',
    "012-ecobrick-history": "In the past, terms such as \"bottle brick\", \"eco brick\" and \"eco-brick\" have been used to refer to a PET bottle packed with plastic.  In 2014, plastic transition leaders around the world conferred and agreed that our concept deserved its own full-fledged and normalized word.  The ecobrick Wikipedia page was updated accordingly in 2016.",
    "013-ecobrick-note": 'NOTE:  Other brick-making technologies borrow the term ecobrick by using a variety of spellings.  Corporations such as Nestle have attempted to appropriate \'ecobrick\' for their cement block corporate social responsibility programs. However, plastic sequestration in a PET bottle is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-Brick" target="_blank">recognized Wikipedia disambiguation for the non-hyphenated spelling.</a>',

    "020-misconceptions-title": "Misconceptions",
    "021-misconceptions-subtitle": "Please avoid the common misconceptions about ecobricks.",
    "022-misconception-plastic-trash": "“Ecobricks are made with plastic trash.\" The Global Ecobrick Alliance, approaches plastic from a regenerative and ayyew philosophy.  As such we do not refer to plastic as ‘trash’.  This is the antithesis of ecobricks which views plastic as a resource. Please avoid associating ecobricks with “waste” or “trash” and rather as \"used plastic\" or \"discarded plastic\".  See our <a href=\"/ayyew\">Ayyew Principle.</a>",
    "023-misconception-building-structures": "“Ecobricks are for building schools and homes” Although you can build structures with them, 99% of ecobricks are applied in projects that use less than 20 ecobricks at a time (such as seats, furniture, tables, garden beds, etc.).  The GEA advocates small and useful applications as a means of empowering a wider section of society. See <a href=\"build.php\">Ecobrick Applications</a>",
    "024-misconception-developing-countries": "“Ecobricks are for developing countries and poor people\" Ecobricks are for anyone who wants to take responsibility for their plastic, and are relevant around the world.

    "025-misconception-recycling-option": "“Ecobricks are for places where recycling isn’t an option” Ecobricks are ideal for places with recycling!  In fact, avoiding industrial recycling and incineration is precisely why most ecobrickers ecobrick.  Intentionally, ecobricks help keep plastic out of the recycling industry.  This prevents the creation of more factories, prevents the emissions of running these factories and prevents fuel burned for exporting and transporting to and from these factories.  Keeping plastic out of industry also prevents the inevitable dispersion of the plastic that has been shown to eventually result. See <a href=\"sequest.php\">Plastic Sequestration</a>",
    "026-misconception-sustainable-development": "“Ecobricks are a Sustainable Development technology” The GEA explicitly differentiates itself from “sustainability” and “development” paradigms. Instead: Ecobricks are a non-capital, collaboration powered, regenerative technology. See our <a href=\"/principles\">principles</a>",
    "027-misconception-GEA-NGO": "“The GEA is an NGO” The Global Ecobrick Alliance is not a company nor an NGO.  We distinguish between these two organizational structures and call ourselves a not-for-profit Earth Enterprise.  See <a href=\"about.php\">About us</a>",
