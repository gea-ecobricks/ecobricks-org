        "005-page-paragraph1": "Brikcoins (BRK / ß) are generated by human work and based on ecological value.",
        "006-page-paragraph2": "More than just numbers in a ledger, every brikcoin correlates directly with plastic that has been secured from polluting the biosphere— and permanently removed from high-emissions industries. In the same way that ancient gold and silver coins have a value in and of themselves, Brikcoins are based on the ecological value that they represent.",
        "007-page-paragraph3": "We call this a <i>proof-of-value, manual blockchain.</i>",

        "010-main2-paragraph": "Two billion years ago, Earth's atmosphere was full of carbon dioxide. The planet's climate was unstable and its surface barren. However, steadily the atmosphere's CO2 was cycled into carbon-based life, which, generation after fallen generation, was buried and secured into the ground. As more and more <a href=\"/plastic\">carbon ended up sequestered</a>, there was less and less CO2 in the atmosphere. Steadily the climate stabilized and Earth's biosphere blossomed.",
        "011-main3-paragraph": "Today, our petroleum based plastic comes directly from these ancient underground carbon stores. As a form of carbon, what we do with our plastic can be of ecological benefit— <i>or not</i>.",
        "012-paragraph-dumping-effects": "When plastic is dumped, it degrades into dangerous micro-plastics. When plastic is incinerated it returns to the atmosphere as CO2. And when plastic that is processed by industry it causes factories to spin and churn, resulting in more emissions and more plastic products.",
        "013-paragraph-securing-carbon": "However, by following Earth's example of securing, concentrating and sequestering our carbon we can keep our plastic out of the biosphere and out of industry. This work has important ecological value insofar as it avoids pollution, disperses benefit, and supports biodiversity.",
        "014-paragraph-plastic-sequestration": "This process of <a href=\"sequest\">plastic sequestration</a> is defined as a manual, net-zero, non-industrial process (see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_sequestration\" target=\"_blank\">wikipedia page</a>). In order to be sequestered, the resulting secured-plastic must meet the criteria of plastic sequestration to ensure that it is in fact green.",
        "015-paragraph-ecobricking": "One of the most universal and accessible means of plastic sequestration is <a href=\"what.php\">ecobricking</a>.",
        "016-paragraph-ecobricked-plastic-value": "Ecobricked plastic, <i>if it has been authenticated to have met the criteria of plastic sequestration</i>, embodies an ecological and utility value. This value can be quantified by the weight of the plastic sequestered within it.",

Ecobricked plastic, in order to be considered sequestered, must meet the <a href=\"sequest.php\">criteria of plastic sequestration</a> developed by the <a href=\"about.php\">Global Ecobrick Alliance.</a>",
        "027-main2-paragraph2": "The final criteria of plastic sequestration, is that of <a href=\"sequest.php\">independent authentication:</a> confirmation that all the other criteria have been met.  In order to authenticate ecobricks that have been made around the world as sequestered plastic, the GEA maintains the <a href=\"/gobrik\">GoBrik platform</a>.  There, every ecobrick logged is peer reviewed by the ecobricker community to confirm whether it meets <a href=\"what.php\">GEA ecobrick standards</a>.",
        "028-main2-paragraph3": "Only when the peer review of an ecobrick is successful, is the plastic within it deemed to have been sequestered.  This fulfils the final criteria of plastic sequestration (authentication), thereby both validating and finalizing the ecobrick's ecological value.  The brikcoins that represent this value are then generated in a block on the <a href=\"brikchain.php\">brikchain</a>.",
        "029-main3-paragraph": "In this way, Brikcoins avoid another pitfall of other blockchain currencies. Rather than favor those who have capital to invest, as a non-capital, manual, and community-powered process, brikcoins favor those willing to work with their hands to make a meaningful ecological contribution regardless of their wealth or location.",

It is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process that is most effectively done manually. If done <a href=\"/how\">properly</a> an ecobrick can be used for long-term <a href=\"build\">building applications</a>; ensuring that its plastic is secured from industrial processing and release into the biosphere.",
        "034-step1-log-ecobrick": "Once complete, ecobrickers log their ecobrick on the <a href=\"/gobrik\">GoBrik</a> platform. A serial number is given by the system and the ecobricker enscribes this permanently on the ecobrick. A photo of the ecobrick with the serial number is taken and the logging completed.",
        "035-step1-queue-review": "The logged ecobrick is then automatically queued for review. The ecobricker is awarded credits that allow them to validate other ecobricks that have been logged.",

        "037-step2-standards": "The GEA has defined standards for an ecobrick. Only when a packed bottle meets these standards is it considered an ecobrick, and only then is the plastic it contains considered sequestered.",
        "038-step2-validation-process": "Using one validation credit, ecobrickers are entitled to validate one ecobrick from the queue. The validator proceeds through a three-step process of reviewing the ecobrick, to ensure that it meets the criteria and standards of plastic sequestration. In total, each ecobrick is reviewed by three validators in the community.",
        "039-step3-title": "Step 3: Authentication",
        "040-step3-authentication-algorithm": "An algorithm calculates a validation score based on the review. The three validation scores are averaged and if the average exceeds the minimum threshold, the ecobrick is authenticated. Brikcoins are then generated and issued to the validators and the <a href=\"https://gobrik.com/#cr\">GoBrik Central Reserve</a> based on the weight of the ecobrick.",
        "041-step3-brikcoin-generation": "The amount of Brikcoins generated is a function of the weight of the authenticated ecobricked plastic. This 'plastic standard' is pegged to a ratio of 1 BRK (ß) to 100g of AES plastic. For example, a 322g ecobrick will generate 3.22 ß, while a 0.41 kg ecobrick will generate 4.10 ß. As the blockchain operates however, this valuation fluctuates. See the live <a href=\"brikchain.php\">Brikchain Explorer</a> for the latest valuation.",
