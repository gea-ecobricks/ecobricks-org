    "005-first-page-paragraph": "Earth and Ecobrick building methods are inspired by the natural building traditions of our ancestors. Countless cultures around the world have their ancestral traditions of working with the earth to build. Many of their structures have stood for centuries. Some for millenia! By adapting their ancient methods to our modern challenges, we can put our ecobricks to good and green use.",
    "006-second-page-paragraph": "With earth and ecobrick methods not only can we build beautiful, strong and resilient structures, we can secure our plastic out of industry and out of the biosphere. Such constructions, rather than result in emissions, actually avoid them, while absorbing physical carbon within them. This ensures that we are not just creating homes, but so too a common home for all the others with which we share ecosystem and biome."
