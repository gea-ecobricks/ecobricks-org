    "005-first-page-paragraph": "By using simple, low-tech methods to build we can build small-scale inspiring constructions that fully embody regenerative principles. As more and more ecobrickers lead and assist in earth building, more and more plastic is sequestered. And as more and more people get their hands dirty building with earth, more and more we reconnect to the earth and... Earth!",
    "007-third-page-paragraph": "Our recommended GEA earth building methods are designed to be both adaptable and scalable. Ecobrick and earth building is fundamentally about working with what resources are locally available– so we encourage you to adapt accordingly to your local context.",
    "008-second-page-paragraph": "We encourage you to start by learning from ancestral earth building methods in your region and starting small. By starting small, you and your community can master methods and principles that apply equally to large projects as they do small. Once we have mastered small non-structural applications, we fully envision homes and structures built with earth and ecobricks.",

    "010-block-1-opener-subheader": "⚠️ Earth & Ecobrick building is fundamentally distinct from conventional commercial building.",
    "011-block-1-opener-subheader": "Today’s conventional construction relies on industrial materials and methods that can only be bought. These materials and methods (and the industries and capital behind them) are ecologically depleting. In contrast, Earthen construction is all about ecological benefit (sequestering carbon, supporting biodiversity, etc.). Instead, we use local materials and locally appropriate methods guided by regenerative principles to ensure that our constructions are ecological contributions.",

    "018-block-2-paragraph-1": "The Global Ecobrick Alliance recommends building small scale green spaces that serve your local community. This means that you can enlist the help of your neighbours to not only get the ecobricks you need, but to help you build. Small builds of two to three layers can easily embody all the principles of earth and ecobrick building and plastic sequestration and make full use of the unique properties of ecobricks for building.",
    "019-block-2-paragraph-2": "Horizontally laid ecobricks are ideal for creating curving garden benches/raised-beds where we can sit, play and eat. In particular, we recommend designing spaces that can be gardened with edible plants (fruit trees, berries, herbs, etc.). Given that most of the plastic we stuff into our ecobricks comes from food packaging, building gardens that grow real food, is pretty apt!",
    "020-block-2-paragraph-3": "Because Ecobrick and earth building methods are non-capital and replicable, students and youth groups can take full charge of a project– from making the ecobricks, to designing the space, to building and gardening. This creates a sense of pride and ownership that is greatly empowering. Best of all, the earth and ecobrick technique you will learn is indefinitely scalable– these are the same fundamentals used to construct houses and buildings.",
    "021-block-2-paragraph-4": "Done properly, benches can be stood on and used to play tag. Done poorly, well… a bench does not have the same risk considerations as a wall or structure. Ecobrick green spaces are a great educational launch into earth building.",

    "043-block-4-paragraph-1": "Our ancestors built earthen structures that lasted decades, centuries, and in some cases millennia! Do some research near you to find walls or structures built using earthen techniques.

    "058-block-5-paragrah-1": "The first step is to test the earth that you will use for your construction. Choose a soil near your building site with a high clay content, no stone, and no silt (decayed organic material). Ideally, your earth sticks together nicely and can be formed into a ball that holds together.",
    "059-block-5-paragrah-2": "Of course, soil is different everywhere! A soil’s character comes from the different amounts of sand, clay, and silt in it. If there’s too much clay in the earth, it will crack when it dries. If there’s too much sand it will crumble when it dries. If there’s too much silt, it won’t hold together nor be malleable like we need it to be. We can, however, adjust our local soil to be better for building by adding more sand to it. To do this, we want to figure out the best combination of sand and earth to make your final building material– what we call ‘cob’.",
    "060-block-5-paragrah-3": "With your chosen earth, make some cob pancakes! It’s just like baking with dirt when you were a kid, but more scientific! Mix small batches of cob with varying ratios of your local sand and clay. Make pancakes of about 3cm by 15cm. Try different rations, like one part sand, two parts clay. Lay out a mix of different rations (i.e. 1:0, 0:1, 1:3, 1:1, 3:1) on a board. Let them dry in the sun and out of the rain. Note that for this testing, we don’t yet add any organic binder (i.e. straw, hay) as we are solely focused on testing the earth. The binder comes later and will add strength to the final cob.",
    "061-block-5-paragrah-4": "After two or three days, when the samples are fully dry, review your pancakes. Break them carefully feeling how they hold up under pressure.",
    "062-block-5-paragrah-5": "Based on your review, you are now able to make an educated decision on the ratio to use for your project’s cob! Choose the ratio that does not crumble easily, nor which hasn’t cracked. Of course, you’ll also want to factor in things like the transportation and cost of the sand. Some cracking (especially for the interior of non-structural benches) is not a big deal– and remember, the binder we add will add strength.",
    "063-block-5-paragrah-6": "Once you have chosen your ideal ratio of sand and earth and have found an organic binder you’re ready to make cob!",

    "066-block-6-opener-subheader": "Cob is made strong by incorporating strong and thin organic fibers",
    "067-block-6-paragraph-1": "Across cultures and continents our ancestors have used earth to make a building material by reinforcing with local fibers. The choice of fibers was largely determined by what was available! In Europe straw from the local grain harvest was used. In Asia, rice straw or coconut fiber did the trick. In some places, where neither was available horse or even human hair was used.",
    "068-block-6-paragraph-2": "Organic binder is chosen by its availability, tensile strength, and flexibility. In other words, when it is pulled it doesn’t break easily and when it bends it doesn’t snap.",

    "075-block-6-paragraph-3": "<b>Caution:</b> Although plastic fibers meet all three criteria above– using it in cob goes against our principles of <a href=\"circular.php\">circular design</a>. Once a construction comes to its end, it is impossible to remove the plastic from the cob and use it again. This means that the plastic will certainly escape, degrade and <a href=\"poison.php\">contaminate the local ecosystem</a>.",

    "081b-block-7-list-paragraph-2": "Cob binder: Gather enough of your binder for your project. Keep dry.",
    "081c-block-7-list-paragraph-3": "Soak your Earth: It is important to soak your earth before using it, especially if it contains large dry rocky clumps. This will greatly speed up the cob-making process and result in a strong dried mortar. Prepare a pit, or raised pool lined with a tarp. For smaller amounts, you can use a large basin or oil drum. Fill 3/4 with your chosen earth. Fill the 4/5 with water. Cover to avoid rain spilling it over (and losing the important sediments) and to prevent it from being accessed by mosquitoes.",

    // Block 8

    "083-block-8-opener-subheader": "Cob is made strong by incorporating strong and thin organic fibers",
    "084-block-8-paragraph-1": "Clear the space where you will be working of all hazards. Make sure that there is plenty of free space to work and move. Allocate a space for mixing the cob, for piling materials, and for tools. Make sure there are no hazards on the ground for when you get started.",
    "085-block-8-paragraph-2": "Use chalk, or stakes to set out the footprint of your build. Once this is done, you’ll want to give some thought to the pathways and flow of the collaboration. This is particularly important if you’re involving dozens or hundreds of participants for a large build. Think about where to place your tools and materials for the different teams that will be working on different aspects of the construction.",
    "086-block-8-paragraph-3": "Plan out the pathways that your teams will move on between work sites, materials, and the build. Try to make sure that the paths do not overlap, and that teams have ample space to work.",

Use the loose ecobricks to finalize the footprint of your construction. This will help you put the final touches on the curves of the footprint and determine precisely how many ecobricks you will need. Adjust as you see fit. When all is ready, remove the ecobricks.",

    "097-block-10-paragraph-2": "Lay medium sized stones in your trench making a free draining foundation. (A land drain could be added on wetter sites). Tamp down. It can be infilled with some smaller stones to make it level with the ground, or a little higher.",
    "098-block-10-paragraph-3": "It is now possible to build with ecobricks on this foundation/rubble trench. If you are building a large structure or if ground conditions are sometimes wet consider raising the walls further from the ground. The Porthmadog site in Wales is on a flood plain and gets very wet in winter, so the chosen method combined aspects of the following examples. It is advised that you examine vernacular buildings for local, cement free and climate appropriate solutions. Sustainable architects and engineers can also help with this.",

    "106-block-11-paragraph-1": "There are various ways to lay your foundation. One option is using a base-layer of cement. The cement is an effective means of preventing your cob bench from seeping up water from the ground, which would undermine its structural integrity. By raising the cement foundation 10cm above the ground, we also prevent seepage in through the benches outer layer in case of pooling rain or flooding.",
    "107a-block-11-list-paragraph-1": "Mix cement to a 1:7 ratio of cement to sand/gravel. You’ll be making two batches. The first will be somewhat wet (the consistency of thick soup) and the second will be dryer (the consistency of yogurt).",

You may also want to add some more sand to your mix. These adjustments help ensure a smooth outer layer with no cracking. Now, you’ve got two choices for your final cob mixture– with cement or without. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.",

    "137-block-16-paragraph-3": "Mixing a small amount of cement in with your cob (1 cement : 6 cob) makes a fast drying outer skin that is strong, water resilient, and semi-breathable. This is the easiest way to complete a construction and does not require an outer render (Skip Step 7). Cement/cob skin is ideal for playgrounds that will endure much abuse over time. This method, however, relies on high-impact industrial cement and requires gloves for safe handling and application. In addition, you potentially compromise the reusability of your cob when your construction comes to its end– the stiff cement-skin chunks won’t make for pleasant mixing and will need to be removed.",
