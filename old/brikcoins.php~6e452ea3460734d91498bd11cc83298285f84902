		<div class="page-paragraph">
		<p>Blockchain innovations have enabled a revolutionary means of exchanging value and recording transactions through cryptographic verification. However, the ever increasing amount of computer work and hardware required has all too often results in higher and higher environmental costs-- all without creating anything of human or ecological value and exacerbating the divide between rich and poor.</p>

		<p>In contrast, the Brikcoin manual blockchain (BRK / Î²)) is based on the generation of ecological value by human work.  Unlike other  blockchains that simply prove the consistency of a digital ledger, Brikcoins operate on the concept of 'proof-of-value'.  Much like ancient currencies were based on gold or silver that had a value in-itself, Brikcoins are based on the ecological value of securing plastic out of the biosphere.</p>
			
		<p>The <a href="brikchain.php">public brikchain</a> of transactions is generated by a permissionless (centralized) process that is maintained and developed by the Global Ecobrick Alliance.  This enables the decentralized authentication of plastic sequestration by anyone anywhere around the world who is willing to work with their hands.</p>

                <p>Many cryptocurrencies rely on valueless, computer driven work to establish their generation of coins and the authentication of their ledger.  Often this work results in the consumption of significant amounts of energy and the generation of ewaste that have a negative ecological impact.  In contrast the Brikcoin blockchain is based on human work to prove that positive ecological impacts have been acheived.</p>

				<p><b>Ecobricking</b></p>

				<p>The brikcoin blockchain revolves around the ecobricking of used plastic.  Ecobricking is an established means of securing plastic. It is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process that is most effectively done manually.  If done properly an ecobrick can be used for long-term building applications; ensuring that its plastic is secured from industrial processing and release into the biosphere.</p>

				<p>Once complete, ecobrickers log their ecobrick on the GoBrik platform.  A serial number is given by the system and the ecobrickers enscribes this permanently on the ecobrick. A photo of the ecobrick with the serial number is taken and the logging completed.<p>
				
				<p>The logged ecobrick is then automatically queued for review.  The ecobricker is awarded credits that allow them to validate other ecobricks that have been logged.</p>

				<p><b>Validation</b></p>

				<p>The GEA has defined standards for an ecobrick. Only when a packed bottle meets these standards is it considered an ecobrick, and only then is the plastic it contains considered sequestered.</p> 
				<p>Using one validation credit, ecobrickers are entitled to validate one ecobrick from the queue. The validator proceeds through a three step process of reviewing ecobrick, to ensure that it meets the criteria and standards of plastic sequestration. In total, each ecobrick is reviewed by three validators in the community.</p>
				
				<p><b>Authentication</b></p>

				<p>An algorithm calculates a validation score based on the review. The three validation scores are averaged and if the average exceeds the minimum threshold, the ecobrick is authenticated. Brikcoins are then generated and issued to the validators and the GoBrik Central Reserve based on the weight of the ecobrick.</p>

				<p>The amount of Brikcoins generated is a function of the weight of the authenticated ecobricked plastic.  This 'plastic standard' is pegged to a ratio of 1 BRK (Ã) to 100g of AES plastic. For example, a 322g ecobrick will generate 3.22 Ã, while a 0.41 kg ecobrick will generate 4.1 Ã.</p>
