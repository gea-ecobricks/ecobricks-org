			<div class="page-paragraph">
                <p>Be sure to start ecobricking right— this is a long-term life habit that you, your household and community are beginning.  Likewise, your ecobricks will set the example for everyone around you.  Sub-standard ecobricks will compromise the quality of furniture modules, constructions and the social spread of ecobricks while, well-done ecobricks can be put to good, safe use and will secure plastic for centuries.  We’ve put this 10 step guide together to help you on your journey of making great ecobricks.</p>

                        <h5>Ecobricks can be used for short or long term applications which balance the benefits of utility and the securing of plastic.</h5>

                    <p>Ecobricks are made with clean and dry plastic.  Start by segregating your plastic from all other materials.  Some ecobrickers bring a bottle with them everywhere they go.  Others save up their ecobrickable plastic in a bin til they have time to get to it.</p>

                    <p>If there is any food, oil or dirt on your plastic, be sure to wash it off.  Dirty plastic inside an ecobrick will lead to microbiological growth and methane forming inside your ecobrick (for a solution for dirty plastic see the Ocean Ecobrick).  Since ecobricks are often used to make home furniture you also want to avoid unsightly ecobricks, bloated bottles and in rare cases, caps popping off.</p>

                    
                    <p>Its likewise important that the plastic is dry!  Wet and moist plastic will also encourage mircobial growth.  Ecobrikers around the world use different methods for drying their washed plastic– from laundry machines to cloths lines.</p>

                    <img src="www.ecobricks.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/02-Choose-your-Bottle-1.svg" width="100%" alt="Choose the ideal bottle type" loading="lazy">

                    <br>
                    <p>  When it comes time to building, having perfectly identical ecobrick sizes is important for making solid and steady modules.  It also helps having at least the same general size of bottle when it comes to building with earth and ecobricks.  Talk with ecobrickers in your community and make the choice together of what bottle to use.</p>

                    <p>When selecting the bottle that you will use, consider three factors: the bottle’s availability, the volume, and the project you will use the ecobrick for.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Availability</b><br>
                        The last thing you want to have to do is buy drinks to have a bottle for your ecobricking!  Soon many people will be ecobricking in your community and it is ideal to have everyone using the same brand and bottle.  Be sure to choose a bottle that everyone can easily come by.</li>

                        <li><b>Volume</b><br>
                        Choose the bottle volume you want to go with.  GEA Trainers teach ecobricking with bottles under 600ml.  Large 1500ml bottles will take a lot of plastic, but also take a long time to make!  Small volume bottles allow first-time ecobrickers to finish their first ecobrick and quickly learn from their mistakes.  Large bottles are best for advanced ecobrickers.</li>

                        <li><b>Your Project</b><br>
                        For building modules with Ecobricks, you need bottles that are exactly the same size and shape. For outdoor building projects, exact sameness is not so important, so long as the volume is consistent (i.e. all 600ml bottles).  Depending on the size of construction, you will need different size bottles.  For example, small bottles make good walls, and large bottles make good benches.  See our Construction Guide for more information on the different ways ecobricks are applied.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Advanced</h3>

                    <p>If you’re thinking of making Dieleman Lego Modules with your ecobricks, you must also consider the top tapper of your bottle. Dieleman modules work best when the distance between the top of the bottle and the start of the tapper is small. This allows more surface area for the inverted peg of the Dieleman module to be attached.</p>

					<p>The easiest, fastest, and perhaps the most fun ecobrick application, are Milstein Modules (MMs). These are hexagon and triangle shaped configurations of ecobricks that are used for sitting, but can be combined together to form one or two level horizontal surfaces. Applications include tables, beds, stages, etc.  All you need are 12 ecobricks to start!  Generic silicone sealant or motorcycle inner tubes can be used to make MMs. Ecobrick Milstein Modules can then slide into deployment for classes, concerts, meetings and more to make horizontal surfaces.  They can be stacked one on top of the other to add one level of vertical height.  They can be stacked and stored vertically to save space.</p>

                    <p>  Well-used ecobrick Milstein Modules will last 2-3 years.  After this time, the silicone joints began to weaken and fail.  Ecobricks also begin to loose their lustre as the colors of the contained plastic begin to fade.

            <p>So this is pretty cool – ecobricks can make LEGO-like blocks!  Dieleman Modules, or DMs for short, are a way to turn bottles into modular bricks that can be stacked vertically.  Sixteen ecobricks are siliconed together to make one DM module.</p>

            <p>DMs interconnect just like LEGOs.  They stack one upon the other and enable you to make walls, towers and columns, quickly and easily without any glue or mortar.  Best Usage:  Awesome for open spaces, indoor playgrounds and building structures for concerts or fairs in minutes. Can be taken apart and stored just as fast!</p>

            <p>The DMs can then be disassembled just as easily.</p>

This method is strong, earthquake resilient, allows curved walls and designs, allows ecobricks to be recycled at the end of the construction, and relies only on 100% organic, locally-sourced materials that cost next to nothing.</p>
            
            <p> Earth building was used by our ancestors to build homes and structures that have endured for centuries.  This general method is known by different names in different languages and continents– cob, adobe, wattle-and-daub, etc.  By using local earth, straw and sand to make the mortar for the ecobricks we can build in ways that are resilient, strong, beautiful, and thermal-retentive.</p>

                            <p>Earth building is in full resonance with our principles — it is simple and replicable, non-capital, non-petroleum, collaboration powered, cradle-to-cradle and potently regenerative. Earth building techniques are gender and age transcendent:  involving men and women, young and old, and everyone in between in the building process.</p>

            <p>The Ecobrick and Earth Building techniques can then be extrapolated for wall and structure construction.</p>

            

            <p>The Earth Building technique can completely cover ecobricks, effectively securing them indefinitely in the construction.  This keeps them safe from UV light and other forms of degradation.  After 10, 20 or 100 years, when your structure comes to its end (as everything eventually does) the ecobricks can be extricated undamaged and fully repurposed.</p>

                    <h4>🟡 Maintenance</h4>
                    <p>Earth modules need to be regularly inspected.  Cracks and breaks to the wall are best quickly repaired to avoid erosion to the structure.</p>

                    <h4>🟢 Next Life</h4>
                    <p>  Earth and ecobrick constructions disassemble into crumbled cob mortar which can be returned to the earth without problem (or reused in another earth construction!).  The ecobricks can be removed from the crumbled cob to be reused in any way.</p>

                    <h4>🔴 Caution</h4>
                    <p>  It’s outside of the corporate construction paradigm: your bank won’t give you a mortgage, insurance companies won’t cover it, and your hands and feet will get dirty.

                <p>It is important not to forget our responsibility when building with plastic.  Ecobricks represent large amounts of secured plastic, and if our constructions lack planning and maintenance, there is the risk of the plastic escaping loose into the biosphere.  Planning for the maintenance and the end of the construction is a key part of plastic sequestration!</p><br><br>


					<h4>Short-Term Maintenance</h4>

					<p>Ecobrick furniture and modules need regular cleaning and repair.  Our GEA Trainer Team who have several hundred ecobrick modules that they regularly rent out to cities and exhibitions, spend one day a year cleaning their modules with a high powered hose and soap.  They also dismantle weak modules and repair them with silicone.</p>
                    
                    <p>Part of ensuring the longevity of ecobrick modules is to train those who use the modules how to handle them.  Modules should always be moved with two hands.  This is especially important with ecobrick Dieleman lego which new users are often tempted to grab with one hand.</p>
                    <br><br>

                    <h4>Long-Term maintenance</h4>
                    <p> Earth and Ecobrick builds often represent large amounts of secured plastic.  When building on government or community land, it is key to establish a long term maintenance agreement with the custodians of the property.  This agreement must include yearly checkups and repairs and also a plan for the destruction of the construction to ensure the indefinite integrity of the ecobricks.<p>

                         <p>Once you have enough Ecobricks you’re ready to build. There are five main techniques for building with bottles and ecobricks.   The easiest, fastest, and perhaps the most fun Ecobrick application, is to make Milstein modules for horizontal building and Dieleman Lego modules for vertical building. With modules you can create benches, table, chairs, structures and more.  Perhaps the best use for Ecobricks is building community green spaces. Using local earth and ecobricks you and your community can build beautiful spaces that enrich the local environment.</p>
