                <p><b>Short-term Applications</b><p>

                <p>Silicone or inner-tube-bands can be used as short-term, non-permanent attachment methods to create ecobrick applications that last for months and up to several years.</p>
                <p> As short-term applications are not usually covered up, they are typically for indoor use, in order to prevent the UV photodegradation of the bottles.  Short term application are easier for people to make and accelerate the <a href="/mandalas">mandalic spread</a> of ecobricking and the regenerative principles they embody. </p>

                <br><p><b>Long-term Applications</b><p>
                
                <p>Earth and Ecobrick building techniques are used to create structures that can last years or decades (it is not uncommon for traditional constructions to last centuries!).  Earth mixes (i.e Cob (material), Wattle and daub, adobe) are used to lay ecobricks horizontally and completely cover them for full protection against all forms of degradation.</p>

                <br><p><b>Very long-term</b><p>
                <p>Short and long-term ecobrick applications put plastic into a cyclical spiral trajectory into the future, where the likelyhood of plastic staying safe, secure and contained is much more likely than currently available alternatives.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Before you build with ecobricks, it is essential to store them properly.  Ideally, ecobricks are stored off of the ground (on a floor or raised on wood) and fully protected from the sun and the elements.  Ecobricks are best stacked horizontally with their bottom pointed outwards.  This enables you to organize your ecobricks by colour and brand– which later facilitates project planning and making.</p>

					<p>The easiest, fastest, and perhaps the most fun ecobrick application, are Milstein Modules (MMs). These are hexagon and triangle shaped configurations of ecobricks that are used for sitting, but can be combined together to form one or two level horizontal surfaces. Applications include tables, beds, stages, etc.  All you need are 12 ecobricks to start!  Generic silicone sealant or motorcycle inner tubes can be used to make MMs. Ecobrick Milstein Modules can then slide into deployment for classes, concerts, meetings and more to make horizontal surfaces.  They can be stacked one on top of the other to add one level of vertical height.  They can be stacked and stored vertically to save space.</p>

            <p> <p>So this is pretty cool – ecobricks can make LEGO-like blocks!  Dieleman Modules, or DMs for short, are a way to turn bottles into modular bricks that can be stacked vertically.  Sixteen ecobricks are siliconed together to make one DM module.</p>

            <p>DMs interconnect just like Legos.  They stack one upon the other and enable you to make walls, towers and columns, quickly and easily without any glue or mortar.  Best Usage:  Awesome for open spaces, indoor playgrounds and building structures for concerts or fairs in minutes. Can be taken apart and stored just as fast!</p>

            <p>The DMs can then be disassembled just as easily.</p>

            <p>Our number one choice for structural building!  This method is strong, earthquake resilient, allows curved walls and designs, allows ecobricks to be recycled at the end of the construction, and relies only on 100% organic, locally-sourced materials that cost next to nothing.</p>
            
            <p> Earth building was used by our ancestors to build homes and structures that have endured for centuries.  This general method is known by different names in different languages and continents– cob, adobe, wattle-and-daub, etc.  By using local earth, straw and sand to make the mortar for the ecobricks we can build in ways that are resilient, strong, beautiful, and thermal-retentive.</p>

            <p>The Ecobrick and Earth Building techniques can then be extrapolated for wall and structure construction.</p>

            

            <p>The Earth Building technique can completely cover ecobricks, effectively securing them indefinitely in the construction.  This keeps them safe from UV light and other forms of degradation.  After 10, 20 or 100 years, when your structure comes to its end (as everything eventually does) the ecobricks can be extricated undamaged and fully repurposed.</p>

                    <h4>🟡 Maintenance</h4>
                    <p>Earth modules need to be regularily inspected.  Cracks and breaks to the wall are best quickly repaired to avoid erosion to the structure.</p>

                    <h4>🟢 Next Life</h4>
                    <p>  Earth and ecobrick constructions disassemble into crumbled cob mortar which can be returned to the earth without problem (or reused in another earth construction!).  The ecobricks can be removed from the crumbled cob to be reused in any way.</p>

                    <h4>🔴 Caution</h4>
                    <p>  It’s outside of the corporate construction paradigm: your bank won’t give you a mortgage, insurance companies won’t cover it, and your hands and feet will get dirty.

                <p>It is important not to forget our responsibility when building with plastic.  Ecobricks represent large amounts of secured plastic, and if our constructions lack planning and maintenance, there is the risk of the plastic escaping loose into the biosphere.  Planning for the maintence and the end of the construction is a key part of plastic sequestration!</p><br><br>


					<h4>Short-Term Maintenance</h4>

					<p>Ecobrick furniture and modules need regular cleaning and repair.  Our GEA Trainer Team who have several hundred ecobrick modules that they regularily rent out to cities and exhibitions, spend one day a year cleaning their modules with a high powered hose and soap.  They also dismantle weak modules and repair them with silicone.</p>
                    
                    <p>Part of ensuring the longevity of ecobrick modules is to train those who use the modules how to handle them.  Modules should always be moved with two hands.  This is especially important with ecobrick Dieleman lego which new users are often tempted to grab with one hand.</p>
                    <br><br>

                    <h4>Long-Term maintenance</h4>
                    <p> Earth and Ecobrick builds often represent large amounts of secured plastic.  When building on government or community land, it is key to establish a long term maintenance agreement with the custodians of the property.  This agreement must include yearly checkups and repairs and also a plan for the destruction of the construction to ensure the indefinite integrity of the ecobricks.<p>
