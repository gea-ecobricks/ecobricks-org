Generic silicone sealant or motorcycle inner tubes can be used to make MMs. Ecobrick Milstein Modules can then slide into deployment for classes, concerts, meetings and more to make horizontal surfaces. They can be stacked one on top of the other to add one level of vertical height. They can be stacked and stored vertically to save space.</p>

        <p data-lang-id="067-plastic-responsibility">It is important not to forget our responsibility when building with plastic. Ecobricks represent large amounts of secured plastic, and if our constructions lack planning and maintenance, there is the risk of the plastic escaping loose into the biosphere. Planning for the maintenance and the end of the construction is a key part of plastic sequestration!</p><br><br>
        <h4 data-lang-id="068-short-term-maintenance-header">Short-Term Maintenance</h4>
        <p data-lang-id="069-ecobrick-furniture-maintenance">Ecobrick furniture and modules need regular cleaning and repair. Our GEA Trainer Team who have several hundred ecobrick modules that they regularly rent out to cities and exhibitions, spend one day a year cleaning their modules with a high powered hose and soap. They also dismantle weak modules and repair them with silicone.</p>
        <p data-lang-id="070-module-handling-training">Part of ensuring the longevity of ecobrick modules is to train those who use the modules how to handle them. Modules should always be moved with two hands. This is especially important with ecobrick Dieleman lego which new users are often tempted to grab with one hand.</p>

        <h4 data-lang-id="071-long-term-maintenance-header">Long-Term maintenance</h4>
        <p data-lang-id="072-earth-ecobrick-agreements">Earth and Ecobrick builds often represent large amounts of secured plastic. When building on government or community land, it is key to establish a long term maintenance agreement with the custodians of the property. This agreement must include yearly checkups and repairs and also a plan for the destruction of the construction to ensure the indefinite integrity of the ecobricks.</p>

            <h4>A Safe Passage Through Time</h4>            
            <p>Building with ecobricks is a significant responsibility. Ecobricks represent large amounts of secured plastic that will last a long time. If our constructions lack long-term planning and maintenance, plastic will eventually leach, degrade, and escape. </p>
            <p>Planning for the maintenance and the eventual end of your construction is crucial. This way, we can put our plastic on a safe passage through time. </p>
