		<p data-lang-id="005-page-paragraph">One of the several core<a href="principles.php"> ecobricking principles</a> is that of <i>spiral design</i>.  Unlike linear and circular design, rather than plan in lines and circles, we plan in spirals.  This way, we can embed an enriching spin of short and long-term reuse into the way we put our ecobricks to use. </p>

			<p>Spiral design principle underlies every ecobrick method and application that the GEA endorses. </p>
			
		 This way we ensure that every ecobrick remains a reusable building block.  This ethic also helps guide the way that we make ecobricks and the GEA recommended ecobricking techniques.

		<p>Learning from the way ecologies infinitely and perfectly cycle nutrients over and over, we aspire to similar indefinitely cycling.  In other words, we make and we use ecobricks using tehcniques that anticipate their next life cycle.   Instead of the straight line of cradle-to-grave, we draw a circle.  We make sure our ecobricks go from one “cradle” (usage/life/build/application) to the next, to the next with minimal energy and waste. This is known as cyclical design.</p>
		<p>This is the reason that when we start an ecobrick we put a colored plastic on the bottom: we’re thinking of the next phase when we’ll build with it.
    This is why we use silicone and not glue when we attach ecobricks to make modules– so that when the module/chair/table comes to its end, we can take it apart to use the ecobricks again.</p>

    <p>This is the reason we build with earth rather than with cement– so that when our bench, garden or home comes to its end, we can extricate the ecobricks undamaged, and put them to use again.</p>

<p>Part of Cyclical Design also includes minimizing the amount of energy and waste produced in the cycling process.  This is where the other ecobrick principles come in!  By ensuring that our methods use local resources, are non-capital, non-petroleum, and community-collaboration powered we minimize the amount of plastic, C02, transportation, and energy required in the cycling.  In this ayyew-way, we’re always striving for tighter and tigher cycling to maximize the regenerative potential of our ecobrick applications.</p>-->

						<p>Every day thousands of tons of plastic flow into the biosphere. Meanwhile, the consumption of plastic and its production increase.  In order to be a deep solution to plastic, a regenerative solution must spread at a rate faster than industrial expansion and economic growth rates.  In order to maximize spread, adoption and collective plastic transition we strive to maximize the accessibility of our methods while minimizing the barriers to adoption. In this way, we empower others to make and build with ecobricks so that they can lead by their own example.</p>

						<div class="side3"><img src="../webp/eb-sky-400px.webp" width="150px">
						</div>
					</div>

    			<p><ul>
					<li><b>Localized:</b> By designing with local, organic or upcycled materials (that are ideally freely available) we remove resource barriers to replication.</li>

    			<li><b>Petro Transition:</b> By designing methods that do not require machines, we remove the barrier of technology, specific skills and dependence on petroleum based energy.
    			Transcaste: By designing our methods so that they do not require specialized abilities we remove age, gender and geographical barriers to replication and empowerment.</li>
   				 
				<li><b>Open Source:</b> By making our designs open source according to creative commons specifications and easily accessible on the web, we energize and accelerate replication.
    			Non-Capital:  By designing methods and using materials that do not require capital, we remove the financial barrier to participation and replication.  </li>

				<li><b>Local:</b>  We strive to use locally available resources in our community in the making of ecobricks and when we build with them.  Ecobricking is all about packing our local plastic.  This begins with the very plastic we have personally consumed, then extends to that consumed in our household and community. Ideally we use PET bottles that come from our community and a stick that comes from our area.  This way we transform plastic that would otherwise cause problems in our area with the minimum amount of energy and the maximum amount of social empowerment.</li>

			</ul>

				<p>When it comes to building with ecobricks, the same principal of localized sourcing applies.  We strive to use local materials, processes, skills and culture for our creations.  For example, we have developed the ecobrick tube banding method of bonding ecobricks to make use of the abundance of free and ‘waste’ motorcycle inner-tubes in South East Asia.  In the UK we learn from ancient earth building traditions of wattle and daub to combine ecobricks using local clay, straw and sand.</p>

				<p>By using materials, goods, services and products that come from within our community and ecological region we likewise minimize our dependence on capital and petroleum.</p>
