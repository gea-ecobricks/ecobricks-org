				<p data-lang-id="005-second-page-paragraph">It can be overwhelming to hear about all the ecological crises of our day.  Climate change, deforestation, ocean acidification— they make the problem of plastic pollution seem minor issue in comparison! However, like all our ecological issues, plastic pollution is a symptom of our petro-capital economy– the way our society is powered by fossil fuels.</p>
				
				<p data-lang-id="006-third-page-paragraph">Of all ecological issues, this makes plastic unique.</p> 
                
                <p data-lang-id="007-fourth-page-paragraph">Through the plastic that passes through our hands each day we can touch— and impact— the petro-capital economy that looms behind it all.</p>
				
				<p data-lang-id="008-5th-page-paragraph">And, precisely because we all use it, plastic provides an unprecedented opportunity for collective action.  Our every plastic choice, compounded together with everyone elses, results in factories spinning, trucks transporting, and oil refined– <b>or, not</b>. </p>
                
                <p data-lang-id="009-6th-page-paragraph">What we do with our plastic, as it spins or slows the petro-capital economy, has big ecological consequence.<p>

                <p data-lang-id="010-7th-page-paragraph">Our daily plastic enables us to make small yet meaningful choices to reduce our participation in the petro-capital economy behind it.  Its a shift from adding CO2 and plastic to the biosphere to removing and preventing them both.</p>
				
				<p data-lang-id="011-8th-page-paragraph">But even more significantly, as a versatile raw material-- once reclaimed and put on a different trajectory, can enable us to build our greenest visions: the very gardens, homes and structures that will compose the green world for all earthen beings that we all long to live within.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="012-9th-page-paragraph">This constructive transition is the goal of ecobricking! It is a shift from the greying impacts of petro-capital participation to our regenerative living.</p>

As the global petro-capital economy steadily spins down, there is, alas, much plastic still to come. Ecobricks are a way that everyone can help secure this plastic and speed up the spin down. When we pack our plastic into ecobricks properly, we are providing the valuable ecological service of keeping plastic out of the biosphere for the long term.

This is important too: when our used plastic is recycled, dumped, or incinerated, it must be transported and factories must spin. These processes are energy, capital, and carbon intense. By keeping plastic out of industry we prevent more fossil fuels from being extracted and burned.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="031-ecobricking-raises-consciousness">Ecobricking also raises our consciousness about the dangers of plastic and the impact of the petro-capital economy. As we become more aware of these dangers and impacts, the more we move on to greener ways of living. This in turn prevents future factories from burning fuels and creating more plastics.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="032-ecobricks-as-building-blocks">Finally, ecobricks are building blocks. But not for conventional building! Ecobrick applications are guided by regenerative and earthen principles. With our ecobricks, we can set about building the very green new world we are transitioning to.</p>

Ecobricking, as a form of plastic and carbon sequestration, is clear, tangible, and immediate. You can touch it!. Because of plastic’s direct connection to the petro-capital economy, our plastic transition is an important indicator of our larger shift to regenerative living.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="037-ecobricking-sequestration">When we pack our plastic into ecobricks properly, we are effectively sequestering it– providing the ecological service of keeping it out of the biosphere. By tracking our plastic generation versus our ecobricking we can track our plastic transition. This is what we call the plastic transition ratio. It is an important indicator of where we are in our regenerative journeys.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="050-reducing-plastic-consumption">Only once we know how much plastic we’re consuming each month and year and we meaningful work to reduce it.</p><br>

            <p data-lang-id="051-focus-on-green-impacts">Once we’ve assessed our grey impacts, we can focus on increasing our green. By tracking our plastic sequestration activities we can mindfully increase our subtractive plastic impact. This is the basis of the Plastic Transition Score.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="052-score-calculation-factors">A household score is calculated with several factors: Your plastic monthly generation and your household ecobricking and household offsetting. These are measured month by month over the course of a year.</p><br>

            <p data-lang-id="053-gobrik-comparison-algorithm">GoBrik uses a per capita algorithm to compare your household to your country’s per capita average. Estimate how you compare to others in your country and GoBrik does the rest using peer-reviewed scientific data.</p>
            
            <p data-lang-id="054-manual-tracking-option">
            Alternatively, you can manually track and disclose your plastic generation yourself. Many ecobrickers do this with a two basket system. Over the course of the month, the plastic that they consume they clean, dry and put in a Weighing basket. At the end of the month, they weigh this plastic, and move it to their Ecobricking Basket. From this basket they grab the plastic for their ecobricks. Meanwhile, they begin the month anew filling the Weighing Basket with their consumption. As the month goes by, they also pay attention to the plastic they give away to others or use outside their home (produced plastic).</p>

            <p data-lang-id="055-monthly-net-plastic-consumption">Each month, GoBrik then calculates the net amount of plastic you’ve consumed so far this year.</p>
            
            <p data-lang-id="056-gobrik-ecobrick-comparison">GoBrik then compares this to the net weight of a user’s authenticated ecobricks made in that year as well as any offsetting that the user has done. A similar process is used for companies in the GEA Catalyst program. Your green impacts are divided by your grey impacts for the year so far.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="057-plastic-transition-score-percentage">The resulting Plastic Transition Score is then calculated as a percentage of zero waste.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="058-score-explanation">In other words, if you’re generating and ecobricking exactly the same amounts of plastic, then your score is 100 (i.e., 100% of zero waste). A PTR below 100 shows your household is still putting plastic into the biosphere. A score above 100 means you are removing plastic from the biosphere.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="084-ecobricking-and-enterprise">Beginning by ecobricking staff plastic consumption, an enterprise can spark the work of reducing its plastic generation. Enterprises can then work with their local communities to catalyze further ecobricking. The ecobricking that comes from such catalyzation is a green impact that the Global Ecobrick Alliance attributes as a green offset to companies. Enterprises can also purchase plastic offset credits, which through the Brikcoin blockchain, directly correspond to authenticated plastic sequestration.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="085-tracking-plastic-transition-kpi">Tracking plastic transition is an essential key performance indicator for businesses serious about going green and transforming their negative impact on the biosphere to a positive one. The GEA Catalyst program and our GoBrik tracking software are designed to empower enterprises to this purpose.</p>
