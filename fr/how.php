Dirty plastic inside an ecobrick will lead to microbiological growth and methane forming inside your ecobrick (for a solution for dirty plastic see the Ocean Ecobrick).  Since ecobricks are often used to make home furniture you also want to avoid unsightly ecobricks, bloated bottles and in rare cases, caps popping off.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="011-block-1-opener-subheader">Its likewise important that the plastic is dry!  Wet and moist plastic will also encourage mircobial growth.  Ecobrikers around the world use different methods for drying their washed plastic‚Äì from laundry machines to cloths lines.</p>

Talk with ecobrickers in your community and make the choice together of what bottle to use.</p>
				<p data-lang-id="020-block-2-paragraph-2">When selecting the bottle that you will use, consider three factors: the bottle‚Äôs availability, the volume, and the project you will use the ecobrick for.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="024-block-2-list-volume-detail">Choose the bottle volume you want to go with. GEA Trainers teach ecobricking with bottles under 600ml. Large 1500ml bottles will take a lot of plastic, but also take a long time to make! Small volume bottles allow first-time ecobrickers to finish their first ecobrick and quickly learn from their mistakes. Large bottles are best for advanced ecobrickers.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="026-block-2-list-project-detail">For building modules with Ecobricks, you need bottles that are exactly the same size and shape. For outdoor building projects, exact sameness is not so important, so long as the volume is consistent (i.e. all 600ml bottles). Depending on the size of construction, you will need different size bottles. For example, small bottles make good walls, and large bottles make good benches.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="052-block-5-paragraph-1">This is part of the circular design principle of ecobricking: we're thinking about the next use of the ecobrick. When your ecobrick is put to use in a module or an earth construction, the bottom color will help make patterns and designs.</p>
						
						<p data-lang-id="053-block-5-paragraph-2">To create your ecobrick's bottom color, choose a soft plastic with a solid color, then push it down to the bottom of your ecobrick. You'll want to fill the bottle loosely about halfway with soft plastic of your chosen color. Then, pack it in with your stick. If your bottle has "legs" or dimples at the bottom, be sure to pack these solid and full. Once all your soft plastic is compressed, you want it to fill the first 1-2cms of the bottle.</p>

If it's your first ecobrick, weigh occasionally to make sure you are on track for your target minimum weight.</p>
						
						<p data-lang-id="059-block-6-paragraph-2">Did you push too hard? In rare cases, when using a sharp stick, a thin bottle or too much lateral force, an ecobrick will rupture. If so, start again.

						<p data-lang-id="065-block-7-paragraph-1">Ecobricks that are solid and strong are densely packed. The full volume is used for plastics, and there is no air or spaces inside. The GEA has determined that an ecobrick's density must be higher than <strong>0.33 g/ml</strong>. This means that a 600ml bottle must be above 200 grams and a 1500ml bottle must be above a weight of 500 grams. Experienced ecobrickers tend to regard 0.37 g/ml and above as the range of good ecobricks.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="066-block-7-paragraph-2">We've discovered that obligating minimum density in your community's ecobricking is essential to ensure quality ecobricks. Quality ecobricks ensure solid and safe constructions and maximize the bottle's volume for securing plastic out of the environment.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="067-block-7-paragraph-3">Ecobricks that are below 0.33 g/ml are too squishy to be used for modules and are not ideal for earth building. Soft ecobricks can compromise structural constructions and will dent easily, which reduces their lifespan. Low-density ecobricks are also <a href="/fire">fire hazards</a> because of the air pockets remaining inside them.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="068-block-7-paragraph-4">That said, a good solid ecobrick that meets all GEA guidelines is something you can be proud of and which will inspire others! An ecobrick's heft and quality set an inspiring example for others and energize the social spread of ecobricks. When others see and hold your ecobrick, they will understand immediately that something important has happened: "waste" has been transformed into something fundamentally useful.</p>

When these ecobricks are used to make modules, the weight of the ecobricks can be too much for the silicone bonds to hold. Also, such modules are too heavy to be safely moved by children or older people. For these reasons, the GEA recommends keeping your density below 0.7 g/ml.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="074-block-8-paragraph-1">So your ecobrick is packed as solid as possible - now it's time to cap it! First, be sure your ecobrick is <strong>not</strong> packed to overflowing. There should be about 1-2cm between the cap and the plastic inside. The cap (HDPE) is made of a different type of plastic than the bottle (PET) and is the weakest part of the ecobrick. If plastic is even slightly pressing up against the lid, the pressure will inevitably crack it over the years. Also, be sure to avoid flip-tops or sports caps when sealing your ecobrick as they are fragile and will break easily over time.</p>
						
						<p data-lang-id="075-block-8-paragraph-2">Once capped, it is time to record your ecobrick! Recording your ecobrick's key data is an important part of ecobricking whether you're doing it on your own or as part of a community. This is particularly important for community leaders. You can use a log sheet, a spreadsheet, or the GoBrik app to record data such as the ecobricker's id, the final weight, date and year, the intended project, and serial number (generated by the <a href="https://www.gobrik.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoBrik App</a>).</p>
						
						<p data-lang-id="076-block-8-paragraph-3">Recording ecobricks is key to calculating your overall impact, monitoring quality, and preparing for building projects.</p>
						
						<p data-lang-id="077-block-8-paragraph-4">By recording the weight, you can tally up all your ecobricks and calculate the total plastic you have kept out of the environment. By recording id and weight you enable quality accountability. By maintaining a record of how many ecobricks you have completed, you'll know when you're ready to move to the building stage of your project. By recording the date you let people tomorrow know that we cared today about their world.</p>
						
						<p data-lang-id="078-block-8-paragraph-5">We've worked hard to craft a universal web app for you to use to log and connect your ecobricks with those in your community. Simply visit <a href="https://www.gobrik.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.GoBrik.com</a> with the web browser on your phone, sign in with Facebook or email, create an account, then begin to log your ecobricks.

						<p data-lang-id="083">Inscribing the weight, data, serial, etc. onto the ecobrick will indicate that the ecobrick has been logged and registered. Be sure to use a permanent means of recording your ecobrick. Your ecobrick will endure for decades and centuries. The more information we can leave future generations, the richer our gift. After much experimentation, we have found that enamel/oil paint and nail polish work best.</p>
						<ul data-lang-id="084">
							<li>Avoid using paper labels, tape, or stickers to record the data. These methods will last for several years at best then fall off.</li>
							<li>Avoid using permanent markers. Not only does their writing not last long on PET, they are made of non-recyclable and non-ecobrickable materials.</li>
							<li>Enamel paint usually comes in a metal can or glass jar. These containers are effectively recyclable.</li>
							<li>Use a paint brush to carefully and clearly inscribe the ecobrick's data. The paint bonds to the plastic and is almost impossible to remove.</li>
							<li>Use contrasting colors like white and black to make your inscription stand out.</li>
							<li>Nail polish is a form of oil paint and also permanently inscribes the ecobrick. However, often the nail polish brush makes it hard to write legibly. Also, the smell of the polish drying is strong.</li>
						</ul>
						<p data-lang-id="085">Some ecobrickers are innovating with other methods; such as etching onto the ecobrick or inserting a written plastic tag into the bottle itself.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="091">Store ecobricks indoors, out of the sun. If possible, protect with a cloth or tarp from accumulating dust and dirt (PET attracts dust and chemicals and is hard to remove). Stack horizontally, with the ends pointed outward. This enables you to organize your ecobricks by colour and brand‚Äì which later facilitates project planning and making. It's good to have the ecobricks raised slightly above the floor ‚Äî rats have been known to chew away at bottles! Ideally, ecobricks are stored off of the ground (on a pallet or raised on wood) and fully protected from the sun and the elements. Ecobricks are best stacked horizontally with their bottom pointed outwards.</p>
