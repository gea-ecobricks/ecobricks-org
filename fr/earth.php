Countless cultures around the world have their ancestral traditions of working with the earth to build. Many of their structures have stood for centuries. Some for millenia! By adapting their ancient methods to our modern challenges, we can put our ecobricks to good and green use.</p>
                
                <p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">With earth and ecobrick methods not only can we build beautiful, strong and resilient structures, we can secure our plastic out of industry and out of the biosphere. Such constructions, rather than result in emissions, actually avoid them, while absorbing physical carbon within them. This ensures that we are not just creating homes, but so too a common home for all the others with which we share ecosystem and biome.</p>

Despite their unique shapes and forms they share certain fundamentals in common– such as using local materials, including the community, and enriching the local ecology. Our ancestors took these principles for granted, but today its more important than ever to learn from the wisdom embedded in their ways.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="029-paragraph">If there’s anything that the very different earth building traditions around the world have in common it is that they used what was local to them. Earth building makes use of the earth (sand, clay, rock, pebbles, etc.) that is nearby along with the local organic materials (wood, bamboo, reeds, grasses, etc.). By keeping it local, we reduce the need for long haul transportation. This ensures a low-energy impact footprint for our building and it encourages the community management of regrowing trees and bamboo to meet local needs.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="030-paragraph">There’s an added bonus. As we’re using the same resources that our neighbours have access to, they can copy us! As we all work with the same resources, we can learn from the trial and error of our neighbours, and they can learn from us. Sure and steady, our methods get better and greener. Since our shared resources come from nearby, we can also work together in the regrowth and management of resources.</p>
          
            <p data-lang-id="031-paragraph">Today’s commercial construction, in contrast, relies on industrial processes and the transportation of materials from far away. Often these materials involve much energy in their fabrication and transportation. Because we don’t get to see where they come from, we are often not aware of the mining, smelting, and energy expenditure behind them.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="035-paragraph">Essential to Earth and Ecobrick building and the effective sequestration of plastic, is its spiral design. This means that whenever we build with ecobrick we ensure that at the end of the construction, the ecobricks can be extricated undamaged and used again.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="036-paragraph">This is one of the chief advantages of building with ecobricks and earth. Unlike cement, when an earthen construction comes to its end, the ecobricks can be extracted undamaged. During the construction life-span, the earth completely protects the ecobrick from all forms of degradation. Then at the at its end, cob/adobe/waddle readily crumbles (especially after some soaking) to release the ecobricks un-scarred. Cement, in contrast, crumbles into stiff hard edged rubble that can easily rupture a plastic bottle.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="037-paragraph">In addition, not only can the released ecobricks be reused, so too can the rubble earth. As it has already been mixed to the requisite ratio, only water needs to be added. After some soaking the earth can be remixed and reapplied in a new construction!

			<p data-lang-id="048-danger-of-plastic">The danger of plastic comes from its exposed surface area. To the extent that plastic’s surface area is exposed to the elements, it will steadily break down over time into smaller and smaller pieces (microplastics) and leach toxins. By packing and covering ecobricks we keep the plastic safe and secure.</p>
			<p data-lang-id="049-packing-plastic">Packing plastic into an ecobrick results in the terminal reduction of net surface area. An ecobrick is essentially many many square meters of plastic compressed into a very small space! Using earth to build with ecobricks is a way to further secure plastic.</p>
			<p data-lang-id="050-earth-mortar">Earth building involves making a mortar (known as ‘cob’, 'adobe', 'daub', ect.) to completely encase ecobricks. This way not a single square-centimeter of plastic is exposed! Without exposure to sun, friction, or heat the plastic inside the ecobricks can no longer degrade in any way.</p>
			<p data-lang-id="051-abandonment-of-projects">It is also important to consider the abandonment of projects. Cob, in contrast to cement, can be more readily populated by plants. Even if long-term structures collapse, earth covered ecobricks have no way to degrade and will remain intact indefinitely. The crumbled earth gradually becomes fertile ground for plants, trees, and forest to cover.</p>

					<p data-lang-id="068-big-responsibility">Building with ecobricks is a big responsibility. Ecobricks represent large amounts of secured plastic, and if our constructions lack planning and maintenance, there is the risk of the plastic escaping. Planning for the maintenance and the end of the construction is a key part of earth building and the overall service of plastic sequestration.</p>
					<p data-lang-id="069-earth-methods">Earth methods are ideal when they completely cover ecobricks. This effectively inhibits plastic degradation through light, heat, fire, and friction.</p>
