        <p data-lang-id="1001-ecojoiner-lead-text">A revolutionary low-tech system to enable the construction of versatile, practical and stunning geometric matrixes with minimal skills or capital using nothing but reclaimed plastic. </p>
        <p data-lang-id="1002-ecojoiner-paragraph">Remolded from locally-sourced, reclaimed-plastic, ecoJoiners enable ecobricks to be interconnected in a wide variety of ways.  Simple ecoJoiners (green) enable  vertices of any length.  Hex and penta hubs (red and pink)  enable lattices with the help of pupJoiners (orange).  All are held fast with sliders (yellow) that takes advantage of an ecobrick's slight compressibility to lock constructions rigidly in place-- all the while ensuring any construction can be easily taken apart and each piece can be used again and again.</p>

        <p data-lang-id="067-plastic-responsibility">It is important not to forget our responsibility when building with plastic. Ecobricks represent large amounts of secured plastic, and if our constructions lack planning and maintenance, there is the risk of the plastic escaping loose into the biosphere. Planning for the maintenance and the end of the construction is a key part of plastic sequestration!</p><br><br>
        <h4 data-lang-id="068-short-term-maintenance-header">Short-Term Maintenance</h4>
        <p data-lang-id="069-ecobrick-furniture-maintenance">Ecobrick furniture and modules need regular cleaning and repair. Our GEA Trainer Team who have several hundred ecobrick modules that they regularly rent out to cities and exhibitions, spend one day a year cleaning their modules with a high powered hose and soap. They also dismantle weak modules and repair them with silicone.</p>
        <p data-lang-id="070-module-handling-training">Part of ensuring the longevity of ecobrick modules is to train those who use the modules how to handle them. Modules should always be moved with two hands. This is especially important with ecobrick Dieleman lego which new users are often tempted to grab with one hand.</p>

        <h4 data-lang-id="071-long-term-maintenance-header">Long-Term maintenance</h4>
        <p data-lang-id="072-earth-ecobrick-agreements">Earth and Ecobrick builds often represent large amounts of secured plastic. When building on government or community land, it is key to establish a long term maintenance agreement with the custodians of the property. This agreement must include yearly checkups and repairs and also a plan for the destruction of the construction to ensure the indefinite integrity of the ecobricks.</p>

            <p>Building with ecobricks is a significant responsibility. Ecobricks represent large amounts of secured plastic that will last a long time. If our constructions lack long-term planning and maintenance, plastic will eventually leach, degrade, and escape. </p>
            <p>Planning for the maintenance and the eventual end of your construction is crucial. This way, we can put our plastic on a safe passage through time. </p>
