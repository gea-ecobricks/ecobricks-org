EarthWands are produced by GEA Trainer and sold by GEA Trainers as a way to fund their ecological work as per the <a href="https://nextcloud.ecobricks.org/index.php/s/pmLJjGJGr3qzdBF" target="_blank">Earthwand Regenerative Finance Document</a>.</p>


                        <p data-lang-id="008-page-paragraph">Best of all, weâ€™ve carefully designed the Earthwandâ€™s production, consumption and disposal so that after all the impacts of its life-cycle are added up, it has in the end made the world a greener place.

                        <p data-lang-id="010-page-paragraph">The Earthwand was developed by GEA principal and inventor Russell Maier.  His goal was to create a product that embodied the Earth principles that power the ecobrick movement-- and that energized them.  His was vision was to create not just a great green product, but also a renumeration model that could financially support the local and global plastic transition movement.</p>

                        <p data-lang-id="011-page-paragraph">GEA Trainers are the official sellers of Earthwands.  Proceeds from the sale go to continuing their work-- uch as conducting as many ecobrick workshops as possible in their communities!  Trainers commit to  contributing a minimum of 25% of the retail price back to the GEA to support its global work.  Sale transactions, and the usage of these funds are fully trackable on the <a href="open-books.php">GEA Open Books accounting system</a></p>.
