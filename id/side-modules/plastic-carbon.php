					<h4>Plastic is Carbon</h4>
					<h5>Plastic is largely made from ancient carbon biomass that was sequestered for millions of years under the earth.  By molar mass PP, LDPE, HDPE and PE plastic are 85.6% carbon. PET is 62.5% carbon and Polysterene is 92.3%.</h5><br>

					<a class="module-btn" title="The molar mass of C2H4C2​H4​ is the sum of the masses of 2 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms, which equals 28.052 g/mol. The mass of carbon in the repeating unit is the mass of 2 carbon atoms, which equals 24.02 g (2 ×× 12.01 g/mol). Therefore, the percentage of carbon by mass in PE is 24.02 g28.052 g/mol×100≈85.6%28.052g/mol24.02g​×100≈85.6%">🔢 Calculations</a>
