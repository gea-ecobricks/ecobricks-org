					<h4>Plastic has a CO2e Footprint</h4>
					<h5>If plastic is allowed to degrade or burn, its carbon breaks down and forms CO2 with the air.  Burning 1 kg of polyethylene (PE) results in approximately 3.14 kg of CO2.</h5><br>

					<a class="module-btn" title="The molar mass of carbon (C) is 12.01 g/mol, and the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 44.01 g/mol. This means that for every 12.01 g of carbon that reacts, 44.01 g of CO2 is produced.  Burning 1 kg of polyethylene (PE) (85.6% carbon), results in approximately 3.14 kg of CO2 being produced as it bonds with oxygen atoms in the atmosphere." onclick="createInfoModal(this.title)">ðŸ”¢ Calculations</a>
