    <h4>Plastic is Carbon</h4>
    <h5>Plastic is largely made from ancient carbon biomass that was sequestered for millions of years under the earth. By molar mass PP, LDPE, HDPE, and PE plastic are 85.6% carbon. PET is 62.5% carbon and Polystyrene is 92.3%.</h5><br>
    <a class="module-btn" title="The molar mass of C2H4 is the sum of the masses of 2 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms, which equals 28.052 g/mol. The mass of carbon in the repeating unit is the mass of 2 carbon atoms, which equals 24.02 g (2 Ã— 12.01 g/mol). Therefore, the percentage of carbon by mass in PE is 24.02 g/28.052 g/mol Ã— 100 â‰ˆ 85.6%" onclick="createInfoModal(this.title)">ðŸ”¢ Calculations</a>
