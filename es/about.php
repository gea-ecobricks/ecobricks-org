				<p data-lang-id="005-first-page-paragraph">The <a href="/story">story</a> of the Global Ecobrick Alliance begins in the traditional territory of the Igorot people (<i>Kaigorotan</i>) in the highlands of northern Luzon in the West Philippine Sea.  Striving to keep our plastic out of the river, we developed means and methods for our homes and communities that embodied the <a href="/ayyew">Igorot Ayyew ethos</a>.  Inspired by indigenous wisdom, today ecobricking principles and methods are a means for households, enterprises and communities around the world to accelerate their <a href="transition.php">plastic transition.</a></p>
				
				<p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">The Global Ecobrick Alliance (GEA) is made up of 400+ transition trainers from all walks of life, ages, and backgrounds.  We are connected around the world in our concern for the biosphere and its harm by plastic pollution.  We are united by the solution we have found in our ecobricking to <a href="transition.php">transition</a> from plastic to ever greener living.</p>

We pack our plastic into ecobricks which we use in our homes to make our furniture and gardens. We lead <a href="/trainings" data-lang-id="013-main2-link1">ecobrick trainings</a> for companies and communities near and far. For both our households and enterprises we offset our plastic to make sure our household and our enterprises are net green. We track and disclose our plastic transition progress, just like the Global Ecobrick Alliance <a href="regenreports.php" data-lang-id="014-main2-link2">does each year</a>.</p>
                <p data-lang-id="015-main2-paragraph2">Our ecobricking has given us a chance to reflect on our own plastic consumption. We feel that solving plastic is a lot more complex than bans and bamboo. While such steps are essential, deeply solving plastic requires an extensive transition of the very way our modern culture integrates with the biosphere.</p>

        <p data-lang-id="021-preclosed-paragraph1">In this way, the plastic that we handle each day is the tip of the iceberg of the petro-capital system that is at the root of today's many of our ecological crises. As such, plastic allows us to physically touch the petro-capital system that otherwise looms large and unseen around us. Our every plastic choice, from purchasing to disposing, results in factories spinning, trucks transporting, and oil refined-- or, not.</p>
        
        <p data-lang-id="022-preclosed-paragraph2">What we do with our plastic, as it adds or decreases the momentum of the petro-capital economy has imminent ecological consequence. Even though our personal choices may seem small, we observe that over time as our choices reverberate with others, they gather a momentum over that time that has enormous ecological consequences. In this way, ‘leading by personal example’ is one of our <a href="/principles" data-lang-id="023-preclosed-link1">core principles</a>.</p>
        
        <p data-lang-id="024-preclosed-paragraph3">As we have come together as the Global Ecobrick Alliance, we’ve realized that to deeply solve plastic, we also have to lead by our allied action, enterprise structure and principles in manifesting <a href="transition.php" data-lang-id="025-preclosed-link2">plastic transition</a>, ecological value and Earth service.</p>
