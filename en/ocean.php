				OEBs were developed in partnership with <a href ="www.trashhero.org" >TrashHero.org</a>, a global beach clean up movement, as a local and <a href ="/principles">regenerative</a> solution to the ocean plastic that they recovered.  Rather than returning the collected plastic to be dumped, recycled or incinerated, trash heroes often use OEBs to secure the plastic that they pick up.</p>
				<p data-lang-id="007-third-page-paragraph">
				An ocean ecobrick is made by packing solid two cut bottles halves with plastic. By definition the making of an ocean ecobrick is manual and does not require machines, special skills or equipment.  OEBs can be used to make make <a href="/modules">modular</a> furniture.

Covered by earth it cannot be degraded by the sun, fire, or friction– much like the carbon the earth put under ground.</p>
                        <p data-lang-id="047-block-7-paragraph-3">Even if these structures last decades or centuries, when the structure comes to its end, the plastic can be removed and put to use again.  In this way we copy how the earth removed plastic from ecology and into long-term geology.</p>
                        <p data-lang-id="048-block-7-paragraph-4">Although we don’t know how it will be used, we do know that it makes a better gift for the future compacted and concentrated than scattered and loose in the biosphere.  In the same way the Earth’s carbon was a gift to our age, we can gift our carbon to another.</p>
