			<p>Ecobricking is more than just a simple solution for plastic.  Guided by regenerative principles, ecobricking enables the transformation of not just the way we manage our plastic, but the way we see it and the world around us.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="page-paragraph">
	

		<p>The regenerative ecobrick movement emerged out of the ancestral lands of the Igorot people in the Northern Philippines over a decade ago.  Deeply inspired by their ancestral wisdom and <a href="/ayyew">ayyew eco-ethos</a>, ecobricking enables us to rise above the old paradigm of plastic 'waste'.  Instead, plastic becomes an opportunity to follow the <a href="/plastic">the Earth's tried and tested example</a> of carbon management.</p>
        
		<p>In this way, as a non-capital, localized, replicable, spiral and net-green process, ecobricking can accelerate our transition from plastic to ever greener harmony with the Earth's cycles.</p>

						<p>For the last billion years, the Earth has been slow and steady greening the surface of our common home.  The way that the Earth has cycled and stored carbon has led to a biosphere unique in our galaxy– while providing us a fantastic example to follow to make it even greener!   With our carbon-dense plastic we can emulate the Earth’s example and participate in the continued enrichment of our common home.</p>

				<p><ul>
					<li><b>Cycles that Spiral:</b>  In the same way that the Earth tended its carbon towards cycles is indefinite reuse, so too can turn our plastic into indefinitely reusable building blocks.  In the same way that the Earth spiralled its cycles towards the enrichment of the biosphere, so too can we ensure that our circular designs do the same.</li>

    				<li><b>Towards Sequestration:</b>  In the same way that the Earth steadily compacted and stored carbon for the indefinite long-term, we can do the same by compacting and concentrating our plastic through plastic sequestration.</li>
    
					<li><b>For Biosphere Benefit:</b> In the same way that the Earth’s processes spun their surpluses up to the benefit of the biosphere as whole, so too can we.</li>

    				<li><b>Towards Subtraction:</b>  The net effect of all of Earth’s processes subtracted  more carbon than they added, leading to more and more life.  We can do the same.  By keeping track and accounting for our impacts we be sure that our net impact is subtractive and greening too– what we call ‘regenerative living’.</li>

    				<li><b>Towards Diversity:</b>  In the same way that the Earth’s processes tended towards ever greater biodiversity, so too do we make the support and acceleration of biodiversity our focus.</li>
    				<li><b>Towards Awareness:</b> In the same way that the Earth cultivated higher levels of consciousness through its carbon cycling, we can do the same by connecting plastic cycling with experiential learning.</li>

                <p>Many cryptocurrencies rely on valueless, computer driven work to establish their generation of coins and the authentication of their ledger.  Often this work results in the consumption of significant amounts of energy and the generation of ewaste that have a negative ecological impact.  In contrast the Brikcoin blockchain is based on human work to prove that positive ecological impacts have been acheived.</p>

				<p><b>Ecobricking</b></p>

				<p>The brikcoin blockchain revolves around the ecobricking of used plastic.  Ecobricking is an established means of securing plastic. It is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process that is most effectively done manually.  If done properly an ecobrick can be used for long-term building applications; ensuring that its plastic is secured from industrial processing and release into the biosphere.</p>

				<p>Once complete, ecobrickers log their ecobrick on the GoBrik platform.  A serial number is given by the system and the ecobrickers enscribes this permanently on the ecobrick. A photo of the ecobrick with the serial number is taken and the logging completed.<p>
				
				<p>The logged ecobrick is then automatically queued for review.  The ecobricker is awarded credits that allow them to validate other ecobricks that have been logged.</p>

				<p><b>Validation</b></p>

				<p>The GEA has defined standards for an ecobrick. Only when a packed bottle meets these standards is it considered an ecobrick, and only then is the plastic it contains considered sequestered.</p> 
				<p>Using one validation credit, ecobrickers are entitled to validate one ecobrick from the queue. The validator proceeds through a three step process of reviewing ecobrick, to ensure that it meets the criteria and standards of plastic sequestration. In total, each ecobrick is reviewed by three validators in the community.</p>
				
				<p><b>Authentication</b></p>

				<p>An algorithm calculates a validation score based on the review. The three validation scores are averaged and if the average exceeds the minimum threshold, the ecobrick is authenticated. Brikcoins are then generated and issued to the validators and the GoBrik Central Reserve based on the weight of the ecobrick.</p>

				<p>The amount of Brikcoins generated is a function of the weight of the authenticated ecobricked plastic.  This 'plastic standard' is pegged to a ratio of 1 BRK (ß) to 100g of AES plastic. For example, a 322g ecobrick will generate 3.22 ß, while a 0.41 kg ecobrick will generate 4.1 ß.</p>
