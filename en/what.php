Ecobricks are made manually to a set density to <a href="sequest.php">sequester plastic</a> and create reusable building blocks that can make furniture, gardens and structures.  This keeps plastic from <a href="/why">degrading into toxins and microplastics</a> and out of high-energy, high-emission industrial processes.  Best of all, the hands-on process of ecobricking deepens our awareness of these issues and their regenerative alternatives– what we call <a href="transition.php">plastic transition</a>.</p>

				Once many ecobricks are available, they can be put to short-term use in <a href="/modules">modular units</a>, <a href="/dms">lego-furniture </a>and <a href="/openspace">open spaces.</a> Later, our ecobrick can also be put to long-term use in <a href="earth.php">earthen gardens and structures</a>.

The bottle and the packed plastic are clean and dry to prevent the growth of bacteria. Typically, ecobrickers use a wood or bamboo stick to manually pack plastic into the plastic bottle.  Plastic is cut or ripped into small pieces then packed little by little, alternating between adding the plastic and compacting it, layer by layer. The bottle is rotated with each press to ensure the plastic is evenly compacted throughout the bottle. This helps prevent voids and that the packing reaches the requisite solidity needed for a building block applications.</p>
