			<p>Ecobricking is a simple way to take personal responsibility for our plastic by keeping it out of industry and out of the biosphere.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="page-paragraph">
				<p>An ecobrick is a PET bottle packed solid with clean and dry used plastic.  Ecobricks are made manually to a set density to <a href="sequest.php">sequester plastic</a> and create reusable building blocks.  In this way ecobricks keep plastic from <a href="/why">degrading into toxins and microplastics</a> and out of high-energy, high-emission industrial processes.  But most of all, the hands-on process of ecobricking deepens our awareness of these issues and their regenerative alternatives– what we call <a href="transition.php">plastic transition</a>.</p>
				<p>
				Once many ecobricks are available, they can be put to short-term use in <a href="/modules">modular units</a>, <a href="/dms">lego-furniture </a>and <a href="/openspace">open spaces.</a> Ecobrick can also be put to long-term use in <a href="/earth">earthen gardens and structures</a>.  In their making and application, ecobricks embody <a href="/principles">regenerative principles</a> and an <a href="/ayyew">ayyew vision</a> that is based on follow the <a href="/plastic">Earth's example</a> of securing loose carbon to green the biosphere.</p>

						<p>
						The GEA maintains standards for ecobricking that are divided into six categories based on the GEA’s six <a href="sequest.php">criteria for plastic sequestration</a>.  The GEA's ecobrick standards ensure that the criteria of plastic sequestration have been met and that our ecobriking is in line with the principles of Earthen Ethics and the<a href="/plastic">Earth’s example of greening the biosphere</a>.</p>

					<ul>

						<li>Raise the individual and collective ecological consciousness of those involved in the process.</li>
					</ul></p>
					<p>
					Plastic that has been packed according to these standards and authenticated as such is considered by the GEA as a valuable ecological contribution.  The GEA maintains the <a href="/brikcoin">Brikcoin blockchain</a> and the <a href="/gobrik">GoBrik platform</a> to enable the authentication of ecobricks according to these standards.  Authentication results in commodification of <a href="/aes">authenticated ecobricked plastic.</a></p>

					<p>Currently, the GEA recognizes three types of ecobricks, regular ecobricks, cigbricks and ocean ecobricks.  See below the technical standards for each type of ecobrick.
					<p>Ecobricking and sequestration standards were developed by ecobrickers around the world and have been refined and are maintained by the GEA.</p>

						<p>Normal ecobricks are made with any size of transparent PET plastic bottle. The bottle and the packed plastic are clean and dry to prevent the growth of bacteria. Typically, ecobrickers use a wood or bamboo stick to manually pack plastic into the plastic bottle.  Plastic is cut or ripped into small pieces then packed little by little, alternating between adding the plastic and compacting it, layer by layer. The bottle is rotated with each press to ensure the plastic is evenly compacted throughout the bottle. This helps prevent voids and that the packing reaches the requisite solidity needed for a building block applications.</p>

		<h4>Personal & Community Empowerment</h4>
		<p>Ecobricking is a both an individual and collaborative endeavour.  It unites across class, continents and cultures around the shared intention of caring for the local and global biosphere. The personal ecobricking process raise awareness of the consequences of consumption and the dangers of plastic to accelerate <a href="transition.php">plastic transition</a>. The collaborative process gives individual and communities an hands on experience of <a href="/principles">regenerative living</a> and points in the direction of other regenerative technologies, such as <a href="/earth">earth building</a> and permaculture.</p>
		<br><br>

		<h4>Learn More</h4>
		
		<p>The Global Ecobrick Alliance has developed extensive, free and open source resources (like this page!) to get you started ecobricking right.  Our goal is to empower you and your community with the know-how to make ecobricks and build with them.  The pages on this site are the result of years of research, experimentation and trial and error by plastic transition leaders around the world.
