    <div class="lead-page-paragraph"><p data-lang-id="010-page-paragraph" ><span class="drop-cap">O</span>VER FOUR BILLION YEARS AGO, like the other planets in our solar system, Earth was a barren and desolate place.  For our planet's first two billion years, its atmosphere was full of carbon dioxide, making its climate hot, harsh and unstable.</p></div>

    <div class="page-paragraph-reg">
    
    <p>However, as the Sun shone down, things began to change.  Steadily, the unique character of our planet began to unfold.  Volcanoes spewed, rivers ran, and ocean currents and tectonic plates collided.  As the surface of the earth dispersed the sun's shine, Earth's atoms began to spiral into more and more complex configurations. Slow and steady, tiny molecular systems figured out how to turn the light of the Sun into life.</p>

    <p>As cells and photosynthesis emerged; plants followed.  By sucking in carbon dioxide nutrients could be made.</p>
    
    <p>Plants grew bigger and trees began to spread across the planet's surface.</p>


    <p data-lang-id="011-page-paragraph">Made from the carbon that they collected, soon vast forests covered the continents and massive blooms of algae filled low lying seas.</p>
        
    <p>As the plants and animals within these ecosystems lived and died, each fallen generation was covered up by the next. Whether on a forest floor or the floor of the ocean, layers of life and the carbon they contained were buried one upon the other.  Over hundreds of millions of years, countless tons of carbon were steadily concentrated, compacted and secured under the earth.</p>


    <p data-lang-id="012-page-paragraph">With all this carbon removed out of the air, Earth’s atmosphere calmed and cooled down. Steadily, life flourished!  Ecosystems and biomes all became more vibrant, diverse and abundant.</p>

    <p data-lang-id="013-page-paragraph">Nurtured by the planet's lush and bountiful ecosystems, one particular two legged ape emerged from the forests about 30 million years ago— and we sapiens shuffled onto the scene.</p>

    <p data-lang-id="014-page-paragraph">Then, on a cold, dark Ice Age night, our early ancestors figured out fire.</p>

    <p data-lang-id="015-page-paragraph">Despite the pesky smoke, our caves were warmed as the carbon of twigs and sticks turned into flames.</p>
    
    <p>Over the mellenia, we got better and better at making our fires.</p>
    
    <p>It wasn't long til we dicovered black rocks that were even more dense in carbon than the heaviest wood.  And they burned even better!  Little did we know that these stones were made from the very plants that had long ago removed the carbon from Earth's air.</p>

    <p data-lang-id="016-page-paragraph">Over the next centuries, certain groups of humans (but not all) got better and better at extracting and burning, what became know as 'coal'.  They discovered other types of ancient compacted carbon too.  Soon they were extracting petroleum and natural gas too. Humans gave the stuff a name: “fossil fuels”.</p>

    <p data-lang-id="017-page-paragraph">As modern nations flourished, their economies began to rely more and more on the easy energy gained from burning these fossil fuels.</p>
        
    

    <p data-lang-id="018-page-paragraph">However, despite the nifty name, these fossil deposits were never fuels at first!  In the process of refining them into fuel, there was a left over residue (5-15% depending on the source) that just couldn’t be used.  This left sludge over began to pile up.</p>

    <p data-lang-id="019-page-paragraph">We soon realized that the residues of refinement could be used too!  With a little chemistry, polymers could be produced—and with a little more; an endless array of marvellous materials.</p>
        
    <p>Plastics had arrived!</p>

    <p data-lang-id="020-page-paragraph">Soon humans were solving all sorts of their problems by making all sorts of amazing things from plastic.  No longer did elephants need to be killed for their ivory to make billiard balls.  No longer did you need expensive silver plates to take a photograph.  No longer did food need to go bad in a few days.</p>

<p>As more products were consumed, more and more factories needed to be made.  As more factories needed to be powered, more and more fossil fuels were extracted and refined. Petroleum and capital flowed while economies grew.</p>
<!-- 
    <p>Encouraged by this new material and all its uses, the extraction of ancient carbon grew.  And so too did the industries and economies based upon it all.  , industries grew and grew.  As they expanded, so did the extraction of carbon, its refinement, and the economies based upon it all. As it all spun faster and faster, there was always that little bit that couldn’t be processed.  This led to industry producing more and more plastic at lesser and lesser cost. -->

    <p>As it all spun faster and faster, there was always that little bit that couldn’t be processed.  This led to industry producing more and more plastic at lesser and lesser cost. And just as burning fuels led to more and more smoke, so too did refining fuels lead to more and more plastic.</p>

    <p>As we consumed one plastic product after another, we tried our best to reuse and recycle.  However, since there was so much left-overs from refining fuelds, it was much easier and cheaper to just make new plastic from scratch.</p>

    <p>Howewver, soon there was so much plastic that it began to spill out of our homes, enterprises and industries. With growing alarm and anxiety we watched as our plastic clogged rivers, littered beaches and piled into great smoking mountains. The particles of plastic were everywhere— inside the bodies of fish and animals— and us.</p>

    <p>Shocked, shamed and determined, our industries and our companies promised to do better!  And they tried. They did their best to convince everyone that there was a solution just around the corner. Companies, scientists, businesspeople and politicians strove valiantly to our processes, products and packaging less harmful, less polluting and less damaging.</p>

    <p>Yet after turning countless corners, despite being less harmful and less polluting— polluting and harmful their processes remained.</p>

    <p>And year by year, the pollution of the rivers and the oceans continued to increase.</p>

    <p>And with it, our despair.</p>

    <p>It was clear that reducing harm wasn't enough.<p>
        
    <p>How could we manage our plastic in a truly green way?</p>

    <p>How could we make sure our products and processes, packing and enterprises were not causing pollution?</p>
        
    <p>How could we make sure that our ways were not grey and harmful in the first place, but in fact helped make ecosystems vibrant and verdant, diverse and abundant?</p>

    But what about the Smoke?
    </p>

    <p data-lang-id="022-page-paragraph">Ever since the first human bond fire, the burning of compacted carbon had been releasing that pesky smoke–  mainly CO2.   As the easy energy of fossil fuels enabled more and more economy, more and more capital encouraged more and more extraction and industry and carbon decompaction– the reduction in carbon density of the original deposits.</p>

    <!-- <p data-lang-id="023-page-paragraph">All the hard work that Earth had been doing for the last few million years, was being undone faster and faster.  While burning some logs created a little CO2 smoke , plants and oceans could manage to suck it back down.  However, as humans began powering their economies with fossil fuels, alot more CO2 was being released– more than the earth could manage.</p>
        
    <p data-lang-id="024-page-paragraph">And since the capital in the economies was based on this burning, it created a self-perpetuating loop.  The more fuels were burned, the more were extracted, and the more were burned.  With so much carbon out of storage and in the air, it began to disrupt the harmony of Earth’s ecological cycles.</p>


    <p data-lang-id="025-page-paragraph">As humans extracted and refined more and more raw fossil fuels, there was always that little bit that couldn’t be processed.  This lead to  more and more cheap and abundant plastic.  And as petro-capital economies grew, so too did the use and application of plastic to cover and package products.</p>

    <p data-lang-id="026-page-paragraph">Soon plastic was everywhere!</p> -->

Soon microplastics could be found everywhere in the ocean, earth and air.</p>

    <p data-lang-id="028-page-paragraph">The more petro-capital economies grew, the more industry produced, the more it burned the more plastic was made. This made plastic so abundant that it began to spill out into the biosphere.</p>
    
    <p>Humans tried their best to put their used plastic back into Industry. But the petro-economy already had so much cheap new plastic, that there was no-profit in recycling the old.  It was much easier to burn it, dump it or send it somewhere else.</p>

    <p data-lang-id="029-page-paragraph">Soon humans came to see that industrial recycling wasn’t working. It became clear that dumpling, burning and exporting created more problems than they solved. In order for the petro-capital economy to continue growing, industry tried harder to convince itself and humans there was a solution just around the corner.</p>

    <p data-lang-id="030-page-paragraph">Yet, after turning many corner, there was still no solution. Meanwhile, there as so much burning, dumping, so much CO2 and so much plastic, that everyone knew that there was a problem with an economy and lifestyle that had to be powered by ‘fossil fuels’.</p> -->
