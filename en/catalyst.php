			<p>The way in which an Enterprise manages its plastic is one of its most telling Key Green Indicators.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="page-paragraph">
				<p>We live in the age of fossil fuel transition.  As petroleum by-product, how your enterprise manages its plastic is an telling indicator of where it is in the journey away from fossil fuel dependence.  Whether your enterprise is reducing down to zero-waste or accelerating up into net-green, there's only one way to truly lead by example and make a definitive difference: <i>Plastic tracking and disclosure.</i><p> 

				<p>Developed over the last three years with over a dozen companies small and large, from Sweden to Indonesia, our Catalyst program, allows enterprises to do just this.  And more!</p>
				
				<p>Using an automated estimation algorythm, your enterprise's annual plastic tracking can be setup in 15 minutes.  Then, over the year, improve your reporting while increasing your green impacts. All your ecobricking, offsetting and community engagement are automatically credited to your account through the <a href="brikcoins">brikcoin</a> blockchain.</p>
					
				<p>Meanwhile, automatic live and yearly reports are generated summarizing your net impact.  This way you can disclose your plastic transition professionaly and publicly on our third-party platform to inspire others with your efforts, courage and transparency.</p>
					
				<p>Together we can catalyze <a href="transition">plastic transition</a> in our local and global communities.</p>

							<p>Today its clear that the vast majority of the plastic we use eventually makes its way to the biosphere.  When your enterprise consumes or produces plastic, we call this a "grey plastic impact".  Tracking your company's production and consumption of plastic is the first step in reducing one's grey impact on the environment.</p>

					<p>The Catalyst program gets you going in no time using a process of estimation refinement. As an owner, manager of president of your enterprise you can estimate better than anyone else how much plastic you are currently using.</p>
					<p>
					Month by month, you and your team will receive Plastic Transition reports.  These reports will remind you and your team to step up their reduction and subtraction initiatives.  As you put attention on your plastic you can refine your estimates.</p>
					<br><p><b>Detailed Tracking</b></p>
				<p>Once your enterprise has established systems for detailed plastic tracking and weighing, you can enabled month by month data entry.  Managers can observe the enterprise's plastic transition charted over the year. </p>
				<br><p><b>Reaching out to communities</b></p>
				<p>By catalyzing ecobrick workshops in communities, you can gain credit for the ecobricks made by participants.  Over the course of the year, our system can track in real time the social increase of your green impact.</p>

					<p>By sponsoring workshops in your community, the ecobricks of new ecobrickers are credited to your enterprise.  By sponsoring GEA training of trainers workshops, the future trainers in these events, their ecobrickers and the communities they start, generate AES credits for your enterprise.
