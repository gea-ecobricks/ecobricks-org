        <p data-lang-id="023-modules-start">Milstein modules require a minimal amount of ecobricks to start. All you need is a dozen or so ecobricks of the exact same size to get started. You can use silicone or old inner-tubes to combine them. Modules are a short-term circular application that with proper care will last years before needing repair.</p>

        <p data-lang-id="024-gea-methods">The GEA approved methods here do not damage the ecobricks during their life cycle. This means that modules can easily be repaired or they can be disassembled and the ecobricks put to use in a new application.</p>

        <p data-lang-id="025-individual-usage">Milstein Modules can be used individually as convenient seats that are sliding and stackable. Hexagon milstein modules can be like honeycomb to create horizontal surfaces like tables, beds, benches and more. Triangle modules can be interlocked with hexagons to make a second level. For full vertical building see Dieleman module.</p>
        <p data-lang-id="026-scalable-applications">Ecobrick modular applications are indefinitely scalable. The more you have the more you can build. Eventually with hundreds of milstein and dielman communities create Ecobrick Open Spaces— interactive community spaces that can be built, un-built, and built again during conferences and gatherings to serve the needs of the moment.</p>

        <p data-lang-id="027-indoor-use">It is important to use modules indoors. Ecobricks should never be exposed to the sun. Ultra violet (UV) rays will gradually fade the ecobricks colors and photo-degrade the plastic bottle’s PET. After only two or three years, the brittle bottle risks crack and burst, releasing all our hard packed plastic. Keeping modules entirely indoors and out of the sun is essential to preventing degradation.</p>

Builders' silicone, also known as “caulking” and “aquarium sealant” is inexpensively found in hardware stores around the world.  Silicone is non-petroleum.  It is not a type of plastic, and it does not degrade into microplastics, nor leach toxins or interfere with ecological cycles. Silicone breaks down into silicon and oxygen when it degrades.</p>

        <h4 data-lang-id="044-preparation-title">Preparation</h4>
        <p data-lang-id="045-preparation-details">To start you will need a well ventilated space, a perfectly flat surface, a caulking gun, a tube of silicone, a knife and of course, your ecobricks.  Hopefully, you’ve followed <a href="/how">GEA ecobrick making and storage directions</a>, so that you can easily pick a selection of colored ecobricks to make a cool pattern.</p>
        
        <p data-lang-id="046-types-of-silicone">There are many different types of silicone – our experience is that the cheapest all-purpose product (<strong>not</strong> special-brand or special purpose version) at your local hardware store works best. Avoid colored silicones and stick to clear.</p>
        
        <h4 data-lang-id="047-safety-title">Safety</h4>
        
        <p data-lang-id="048-safety-guidelines">Make sure you’re working outside or with a fan, because as silicone cures it releases vinegar gas (acetic acid).  It’s not good for you or your helpers if you breathe too much of this.  Ideally, have a partner assist:  one person holds and places the ecobricks, the other operates the silicone gun.</p>
        
        <h4 data-lang-id="049-start-title">To Start…</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <p><li data-lang-id="050-start-step1">Go through your available ecobricks and create a beautiful pattern using the bottom colors of the ecobricks.  Arrange your ecobricks in the desired module pattern with the bottom down.</li></p>
            <li data-lang-id="051-start-step2">When your pattern is set, remove the cap of the center ecobrick (this will help guide you as the module grows).</li>
            <li data-lang-id="052-start-step3">Insert the silicone tube into your caulking gun and use your knife to cut the top off your silicone tube and the nozzle.  Be sure to ecobrick the plastic cuttings!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 data-lang-id="053-siliconing-title">Siliconing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li data-lang-id="054-siliconing-step1">One partner removes the center ecobrick from the test arrangement and holds it for the other to silicone.</li>
            <li data-lang-id="055-siliconing-step2">Lay a single thick bead of silicone down the side of the ecobrick.  The bead should be high, not squished or flat – this will help create the strongest bonds between bottles.</li>
            <li data-lang-id="056-siliconing-step3">Place the bottle down in the center of the flat space you’ve chosen.  Take the next ecobrick, and press it gently against your center bottle.  And you're off!</li>
            <li data-lang-id="057-siliconing-step4">Grab the third bottle.  This time add two beads of silicone down the sides of the bottle (where the bottles will touch the two others).  Gently press this bottle against the first two.</li>
            <li data-lang-id="058-siliconing-step5">Ideally your high silicone beads compress nicely, maximizing the contact surface.</li>
            <li data-lang-id="059-siliconing-step6">Continue adding ecobricks in this way, from the center outwards.</li>
            <li data-lang-id="060-siliconing-step7">Be sure as you press new bottles into the pattern that you do not disturb the bonds of the earlier bottles.  Try to avoid repressing bottles together after they’ve been set.  Undisturbed silicone joints are strongest.</li>
            <li data-lang-id="061-siliconing-step8"><strong>Be careful as you work to not lean over the pattern</strong>— the vinegar fumes from the silicone are strongest here.  Always work from around the outside.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 data-lang-id="062-finishing-up-title">Finishing up</h4>
        <ul>
            <li data-lang-id="063-finishing-up-step1">Once all your bottles are all laid, its time to… <strong>wait</strong>!</li>
            <li data-lang-id="064-finishing-up-step2">Do not move or even touch your module for the next two hours.  After two hours, you can safely put the cap back on the center bottle and if necessary gently slide the modules (but it's best not to!).</li>
            <li data-lang-id="065-finishing-up-step3">After 24 hours you can move the module.</li>
            <li data-lang-id="066-finishing-up-step4">After 36 hours (i.e. when you can no longer smell the silicone drying) your module is good to sit and even stand on!</li>

            <p data-lang-id="075-mechanic-shop-advantage">With luck, you have a mechanics shop near you that works with motor bikes. By using the old inner tubes from motor cycles we can also connect our ecobricks together. Unfortunately, bicycle and car tires are too small and too big for the straightforward application of this method. But you’re welcome to try – it all depends on the diameter of your ecobricks and that of the inner-tube.</p>
            
            <p data-lang-id="076-tire-banding-explanation">Unlike old methods of tying a stack of ecobricks together with a long vertical strip of innertube, in the tire banding technique, we cut the tubes <strong>horizontally</strong> to make many small elastic bands. Just like the siliconing method, we’re not permanently bonding the ecobricks together, so that later the module can be fixed or destroyed without damaging the ecobricks.</p>
            
            <p data-lang-id="077-collaborative-making">Like all ecobrick applications, the making process works best collaboratively. You’ll need a partner, some ecobricks and a wooded stick. Your ecobrick packing stick or an <a href="earthwand.php" data-lang-id="078-earthwand-link">earthwand</a> will do the trick!</p>
            
            <h4 data-lang-id="079-getting-started">Getting Started</h4>
            
            <p data-lang-id="080-motor-cycle-tires-ideal">We’ve found that motor cycle tires are ideal for binding 600ml bottles. Use only identical bottled ecobricks for one module. Really old inner tubes, or those that have been exposed to the sun won’t work – they will snap too easily.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li data-lang-id="081-cutting-inner-tube-instruction">Take your scissors and cut across the inner tube to make a ring. As you cut the tube into bands, angle your cuts slightly so that the bottom of the band is slightly smaller than the top – about 1 centimenter on the bottom and 1.3 cm on the top. This will help you maximize the number of bands you can get out of the tube, while minimizing waste.</li>
                
                <li data-lang-id="082-start-with-few-bands">Cut only about six bands to start as you will need to test the dimensions/elastacity of your bands before you cut the rest of the tire.</li>
                
                <li data-lang-id="083-ecobrick-arrangement">Hopefully you’ve follow the recommended ecobrick <a href="how.php" data-lang-id="084-making-storage-methods-link">making and storage methods</a> so that you’re ecobricks have colored bottoms and are easily accessible. Arrange your ecobricks to make a pattern of colored bottoms (this will be the top of your module).</li>
                
                <li data-lang-id="085-connecting-ecobricks">Slide a band over the bottom and the top of your center ecobrick. Bring out the adjacent ecobrick. Slide the top and bottom elastics over the second ecobrick so that it is partnered with the first.</li>
                
                <li data-lang-id="086-creating-a-triad">Now connect your second ecobrick, in the same way to a third. In this way you’ll have three partners attached in a line.</li>
                
                <li data-lang-id="087-adjusting-bond-tightness">Push all three bottles together and connect bottle the first bottle, to the third. The ecobricks should be tightly bonded in a triad! They should not be able to slide back and forth or wiggle. If your bonds are too loose (or too tight!), go back to cutting your elastics.

            <p data-lang-id="101-module-lifespan">All in all, you can expect an indoor module to last 3-5 years. After this time, the silicone bonds will begin to fail. Silicone modules, can be easily repaired by removing loose bottles, clearing off their old silicone, cleaning their surface and re-siliconing. The same goes for tire-band modules; simply reattach the bottle.</p>

            <p data-lang-id="103-cutting-bottles-out">When your module comes to the end of its life, use a sharp knife to cut the bottles out of the pattern. Be sure not to cut the PET of the bottle as you do so– often pulling the bottles apart will suffice.</p>
            
            <p data-lang-id="104-silicone-module-disassembly">For silicone modules, you can also use vinegar or isopropyl alcohol to weaken and dissolve the bonds. Clear the old silicone from the old bottles.& Your ecobricks can now be reused to make modules or applied in <a href="earth.php" data-lang-id="105-earth-ecobrick-constructions-link">earth and ecobrick constructions</a>.</p>
            
            <p data-lang-id="106-silicone-disposal">You can safely dispose of silicone sealant in your garden, ideally in a sunny place. Silicone is not plastic, nor is it petroleum based. It degrades harmless back into its inorganic components of amorphous silica, carbon dioxide, and water vapor (SO, CO2, H2O).</p>

            <p data-lang-id="109-tire-banded-modules-caution"><strong>With the tire banded modules it is critical to keep them out of the sun.</strong> Inner tubes are made from butyl rubber from petrochemicals. Inner tubes are highly susceptible to photodegradation and will weaken within weeks of UV exposure. Butyl rubber degrades by breaking down into small and smaller pieces similar to micro-plastics. These do not biodegrade and instead accumulate in the environment. Butyl rubber is seldom recycled, so it is best to pack broken pieces and cuttings into an ecobrick.</p>

This way they can be put to use again.  Silicone and tire bands can both be cut to release the ecobricks without any damage to the PET bottle.  Silicone methods with minimal sun exposure can last for 3-5 years.  After this time, the silicone begins to let go of the ecobricks.  The modules can either be repaired, or disassembled. </p><h4>Transcaste</h4><p>The spirit of Milstein modules is one that empowers across the barriers of geography, age and gender to put one’s plastic to go use. Module making are designed to readily involve men, women, the young, old, rich, poor and everyone in between.</p><div id="attachment_64730" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://cdn.ecobricks.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Impact-Assessment-Balance-Logo-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64730" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-64730 " src="https://cdn.ecobricks.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Impact-Assessment-Balance-Logo-1-300x300.png" alt="" width="230" height="230"></a><p id="caption-attachment-64730" class="wp-caption-text">We’re careful that the net impact of our module projects is greening.</p></div><h4>Regenerative</h4><p>Ecobricking and module making has a fundamental green impact – we’re sequestering plastic and CO2 by our efforts!

Requiring furniture for his home, but having no means to procure it, Russell Maier, did the next best thing – he made it with what was freely available. Living in a small village in the remote Northern Philippines, there weren’t any furniture stores near Russell’s home, but there were lots of ‘waste’ glass bottles! Under many houses in the village were stores of unrecyclable gin bottles that had accumulated over the years. Russell began to experiment with the square, brick-like glass bottles that his neighbours were only too happy to get rid of.</p>

Dan helped accentuate the defining theme of the movement of transforming the perspective of plastic as “waste,” “useless,” or “trash.” Dan encouraged Russell to see the wisdom in the Igorot people he was living with. Dan's own example of <i>“trusting in the universe”</i> in serving people and planet inspired Russell to do the same. Although they never met, Russell and Dan built up a strong friendship.
