				<p data-lang-id="005-first-page-paragraph">GoBrik is a social action platform providing ecobrickers and their communities around the world with the tools to log, track, exchange and manage their ecobricking.  GoBrik is a project of the <a href="about.php">Global Ecobrick Alliance (GEA) Earth Enterprise</a>.  Launched in 2017, GoBrik now connects 50,000 users and 5,000 communities from 120 countries through their <a href="what.php">ecobricking</a>.  The core of the platform is our community of planet passionate ecobrickers.  Through their hard word, our ecobrick authentication system is generating our <a href="brikcoins.php">brikcoin manual blockchain</a>.

                                		<p data-lang-id="009-block-1-main-p1"> And that includes plastic. Plastic is not just an ugly consequence of the petro-capital economy - it is our spring board to transcending it.</p>
				                <p data-lang-id="010-block-2-main-p2">To solve plastic pollution and to transcend the petro-capital economy at the root of it, we must dive deep into... <i>plastic.</i> Rather than sending our personal plastic on polluting journeys, through ecobricking we can generate the building blocks and currency. By connecting ecobrickers- uniquely committed planet-passionate global citizens- GoBrik has a tremendously unique base of users who, like the GEA, are not motivated by capital or profit- but ecological and community concern.</p>
				                <p data-lang-id="011-block-3-main-p3">United by this shared passion, ecobricking lays the foundation for much more than just ecobricking! With a shared currency, a shared metric and vision of plastic transition, our vision is of a decentralized app that can be deployted by regenerative communities around the world to coalesce their local efforts and unite them to the global movement.</p>
				                <p data-lang-id="012-block-4-main-p4">In the recycling industry plastic is only valued as a raw material. GoBri enables us to value plastic for precisely the opposite: its removal from the global industrial system to be secured and put to good local use. Our vision os of the GoBrik platform doing just this- accelerating the sequestration of plastic and our transition from it. By generating ciurrency and connection on the valuation of their service, we envision not just making a dent in the millions of tons of plastic that will be produced in the next decade, but using that plastic as the building blocks for a whole new regenerative world.</p>

	<p data-lang-id="019-block-4-p1">Over 2388 Ecobricks were logged in our first three month run of the first Ecobrick App in Jogja.</p>
	<p data-lang-id="020-block-4-p2">From the very beginning, we observed that schools that kept track of their ecobricking were most likely to have the highest quality ecobricks, to build the coolest stuff, and to see the deepest plastic transition.  These schools were then able to speak of their success with solid numbers.  Inspired, we’re working to build the GoBrik app to help ecobrickers everywhere track and connect their ecobricking and we’re developing Brikcoins as a means to value the hard and valuable work of ecobrickers securing plastic from contaminating the biosphere.</p>
        <p data-lang-id="021-block-4-p3">In March 2016, <a href="/new-ecobricks-web-app-launched">we launched the first version of our app</a> to a team of twenty trainers in the city of Jogjakarta, Indonesia.  Basically an upgraded google form embedded in a WordPress site, they were able to log the Ecobricking of hundreds of Jogjans over the course of three months.  In June 2016, we were able to host a ecobrick media event to unveil the Ecobricks that had been made in three months, as well as detailed statistics of the amount of plastic packed, participation and C02 sequestered.  This was followed by the launch of an improved app for NU, a large muslim organization in Jakarta.  Empowered with their own <a href="http://www.nu.ecobricks.org/">NU App</a>, they began logging and tracking their ecobricks.</p>
        <p data-lang-id="022-block-4-p4">Despite the success of our first Jogja and NU apps, the logging functionality was significantly limited.  One could not see or track one’s personal ecobricking.  The logging thus became the responsibility of one or two trainers– the rest recording on paper for these people to process.</p>
        <p data-lang-id="023-block-4-p5">With the insights that we have gleaned from our sociological observations of the spread of Ecobricks in Indonesia and the Philippines, coupled with our prototype app field testing, we went back to the drawing board.</p>
        <p data-lang-id="024-block-4-p6">In early 2017, with the guidance of veteran programmers, crypto-currency experts, and data base designer, we had a massive breakthrough in our app development.  Having designed a relational database, we found the Knack.com platform to create it. Within two months the pieces were in place.  The second version of our Ecobricks app was launched in the second half of 2017.</p>
        <p data-lang-id="025-block-4-p7">In mid 2018 our <a href="/brikcoins">Ecobrick & Brikcoin White Paper</a> was released and shortly thereafter our Brikcoin manual block chain.</p>

        <p data-lang-id="031-block-5-p5">The cost incurred in the ongoing sequestration of plastic through the maintenance and development of GoBrik are tracked in our <a href=".../open-books.php">Open Books</a>.  By comparing the past year’s net cost of running the platform vs. the amount amount of plastic authenticated in that year, enables us to determine the next year’s price per Kg.   This value also corresponds to the total Brikcoins generated in the year.  The purchase price of each Kg of plastic offset is thus at a set price and a set Brikcoin correlation– with the buyer’s personal or company account being credited with both plastic offsets and brikcoins.  The transaction is recorded in both our <a href="http://www.gobrik.com/#brikchain>blockchain"</a> and our <a href=".../open-books.php">open books.</a></p>
        <p data-lang-id="032-block-5-p6">Offset purchases enables the GEA to continue our work.  Purchases also help float the fiat value of brikcoins– which distributes value and incentive for the entire ecobricker network.</p>
