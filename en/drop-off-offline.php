  				<p>Please be aware that there are currently no drop off points as such. Now and again projects may ask for specific bricks to speed up their construction. These requests will usually be advertised locally on social media channels.</p>
  				<p>If you have Ecobricks, then why not make a small module for your home or garden? You could combine with your neighbours to make something for your community. To see completed projects from around the world scroll down to our homepage where you will find a gallery</p>
