		<p>One of the several core<a href="principles.php"> ecobricking principles</a> is that of <i>spiral design</i>.  Unlike linear and circular design, rather than plan in lines and circles, we plan in spirals.  This way, we can embed an enriching spin of short and long-term reuse into our ecobrick designs. </p>

			<p>Spiral design principle underlies every ecobrick method and application that the GEA endorses. </p>
			
		 This way we ensure that every ecobrick remains a reusable building block.  This ethic also helps guide the way that we make ecobricks and the GEA recommended ecobricking techniques.

		<p>Learning from the way ecologies infinitely and perfectly cycle nutrients over and over, we aspire to similar indefinitely cycling.  In other words, we make and we use ecobricks using tehcniques that anticipate their next life cycle.   Instead of the straight line of cradle-to-grave, we draw a circle.  We make sure our ecobricks go from one “cradle” (usage/life/build/application) to the next, to the next with minimal energy and waste. This is known as cyclical design.</p>
		<p>This is the reason that when we start an ecobrick we put a colored plastic on the bottom: we’re thinking of the next phase when we’ll build with it.
    This is why we use silicone and not glue when we attach ecobricks to make modules– so that when the module/chair/table comes to its end, we can take it apart to use the ecobricks again.</p>

    <p>This is the reason we build with earth rather than with cement– so that when our bench, garden or home comes to its end, we can extricate the ecobricks undamaged, and put them to use again.</p>

<p>Part of Cyclical Design also includes minimizing the amount of energy and waste produced in the cycling process.  This is where the other ecobrick principles come in!  By ensuring that our methods use local resources, are non-capital, non-petroleum, and community-collaboration powered we minimize the amount of plastic, C02, transportation, and energy required in the cycling.  In this ayyew-way, we’re always striving for tighter and tigher cycling to maximize the regenerative potential of our ecobrick applications.</p>-->

				<div class="lead-panel-paragraph"><p>Today, the vast majority of the products we use go from their birth in a factory, into our hands, to their grave. Pollution is the result.  Designs that fail to anticipate and plan for the end of a product are known as "cradle-to-grave".</p></div>
						
				<p>Unfortunately, products and materials that are designed to be 'circular' also lead to pollution and ecological depletion.  Although, "cradle-to-cradle" designs that can be used over are a step in the right direction, if the external impacts of each cycle aren't considered carefully (for example the making and fueling of the factory that makes a product), a spiral of depletion will result.  Alas, we see this all too clearly with traditional industrial recycling:  each time a piece of plastic is recycled, large amounts of emission-intensive transportation, sorting, smelting are required.</p>

        
				<p>With ecobricks, we do things differently!  </p>
	
		<p>Guided by the first principle of <a href="https://book.earthen.io/summaries">Earthen ethics</a>, the cycles of ecobricks and their applications are designed to be <i>greening</i>.  Not only do we plan for the next-life of our application, we also plan for its subsequent cycles. </p>
		
		<p>To do so, we leverage the resilient properties of plastic to create reusable building blocks that have a procession of short and long-term applications.   This means that we ensure that ecobricks are both indefinitely reusable and that that each cycle of building and dissembly contributes socially and ecologically.

						<p>Every day thousands of tons of plastic flow into the biosphere. Meanwhile, the consumption of plastic and its production increase.  In order to be a deep solution to plastic, a regenerative solution must spread at a rate faster than industrial expansion and economic growth rates.  In order to maximize spread, adoption and collective plastic transition we strive to maximize the accessibility of our methods while minimizing the barriers to adoption. In this way, we empower others to make and build with ecobricks so that they can lead by their own example.</p>

    			<p><ul>
					<li><b>Localized:</b> By designing with local, organic or upcycled materials (that are ideally freely available) we remove resource barriers to replication.</li>

    			<li><b>Petro Transition:</b> By designing methods that do not require machines, we remove the barrier of technology, specific skills and dependence on petroleum based energy.
    			Transcaste: By designing our methods so that they do not require specialized abilities we remove age, gender and geographical barriers to replication and empowerment.</li>
   				 
				<li><b>Open Source:</b> By making our designs open source according to creative commons specifications and easily accessible on the web, we energize and accelerate replication.
    			Non-Capital:  By designing methods and using materials that do not require capital, we remove the financial barrier to participation and replication.  </li>

				<li><b>Local:</b>  We strive to use locally available resources in our community in the making of ecobricks and when we build with them.  Ecobricking is all about packing our local plastic.  This begins with the very plastic we have personally consumed, then extends to that consumed in our household and community. Ideally we use PET bottles that come from our community and a stick that comes from our area.  This way we transform plastic that would otherwise cause problems in our area with the minimum amount of energy and the maximum amount of social empowerment.</li>

			</ul>

				<p>When it comes to building with ecobricks, the same principal of localized sourcing applies.  We strive to use local materials, processes, skills and culture for our creations.  For example, we have developed the ecobrick tube banding method of bonding ecobricks to make use of the abundance of free and ‘waste’ motorcycle inner-tubes in South East Asia.  In the UK we learn from ancient earth building traditions of wattle and daub to combine ecobricks using local clay, straw and sand.</p>

				<p>By using materials, goods, services and products that come from within our community and ecological region we likewise minimize our dependence on capital and petroleum.</p>

However, using silicone, these applications enable full dissembly, reuse and making of subsequent modules.</p>

			<div class="page-paragraph">    
			
			<p>It can be helpful to better understand what we mean by spiral design by clarifying what it is not.  Ecobricking is often mistaken a ‘sustainable’ or 'circular' technology.  These terms tends to refer to enabling our current human systems to continue to spin on indefinitely by minimizing damage and environmental harm.  Instead, with our ecobricks we strive for a fundamental shift towards net contribution.  Instead of a static circle, by intending our cycles we can spiral them towards richer societies and greener ecosystems.</p>

			<p>Spiral design is inspired by the concept of Ayyew in the culture of the Igorot people of Northern Luzon.  This Igorot concept inspired and guided the <a href="../story">early Asian ecobrick movement</a>, the work of the <a href="about">GEA</a> and the development of our <a href="principles.php">Earthen principles</a>.</p>
