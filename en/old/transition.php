				<p>By transitioning from our plastic we can shift from petro-capital participation to the regeneration of the biosphere.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="page-paragraph">
				  

				<p>It can be overwhelming to hear about all the ecological crises of our day.  Climate change, deforestation, ocean acidification-- they make the problem of plastic pollution seem minor issue in comparison! However, like all our ecological issues, plastic pollution is a symptom of our petro-capital economy‚Äì the way our money and energy is powered by fossil fuels.</p>
				
				<p>Of all ecological issues, this makes plastic unique.</p> 
                
                <p>Through our the plastic that passes through our hands each day we can touch-- and impact-- the petro-capital economy that is otherwise so overwhelming huge and invisible.</p>
				
				<p>And, because we all use it, plastic provides a unique opportunity for collective action.  Our every plastic choice, compounded together with many other people's,results in factories spinning, trucks transporting, and oil refined‚Äì <b>or, not</b>. </p>
                
                <p>What we do with our plastic, as it spins or slows the petro-capital economy has big ecological consequence.<p>

                <p>Our daily plastic enables us to make small yet meaningful choices to reduce our participation in the petro-capital economy behind it.  Its a shift from adding CO2 and plastic to the biosphere to removing and preventing them both.</p>

                <p>This transition is the goal of ecobricking! It is a shift from the greying impacts of petro-capital participation to regenerative living.</p>

                            <p>Plastic is made from fossil fuels and is largely carbon.  As our petro-capital plastic slowly spins down, there is much plastic still to come.  Ecobricks are a way that everyone can help secure this plastic, and speed up the spin down.   When we pack our plastic into ecobricks properly, we are effectively sequestering it:  providing the valuable ecological service of keeping plastic out of the biosphere for the long term.  </p>

					<p>Ecobricking also keeps plastic out of industry.  When our used plastic is recycled, dumped, or incinerated, it must be transported and factories must spin.  These processes are energy, capital and carbon intense.  By keeping plastic out of industry we prevent more fossil fuels from being extracted and burned.</p>
						
					<p>Ecobricking also raises our consciousness about the dangers of plastic and the impact of the petro-capital economy.  As we become more aware of these dangers and impacts, the more we move on to greener ways of living.  This in turn prevents future factories from burning fuels and creating more plastics.</p>

					<p>While living modern lives it is all but impossible to avoid consuming plastic and CO2 emissions.  As the petro-capital economy spins down, we can do our part by ensuring our green impacts are greater than our grey.</p>

					<p>While CO2 subtraction is crucial, it can also be abstract.  Ecobricking, as a form of plastic and carbon sequestration, is clear, tangible and immediate.  Because of plastic‚Äôs direct connection to the petro-capital economy, our plastic transition is an important indicator of our larger shift to regenerative living.</p>

					<p>When we pack our plastic into ecobricks properly, we are effectively sequestering it‚Äì providing the ecological service of keeping it out of the biosphere.  By tracking our plastic generation versus our ecobricking we can track our plastic transition. This is what we call the plastic transition ratio.  It is an important indicator of where we are in our regenerative journeys.</p>

					<p>Before we were simply focused on reducing our grey harm (i.e. ‚Äúreducing footprints‚Äù, ‚Äúzero waste‚Äù and ‚Äúcarbon neutral‚Äù) by focusing on our green impacts, we can way beyond.   In the Ayyew spirit, our green contributions can go many times beyond of our grey and put us on a journey of cultivating ever greener harmony with the cycles of life around us.</p>

					<p>The Global Ecobrick Alliance has developed fomulas, standards and indicators to generate a Plastic Transtion Score on the GoBrik.com app.  By comparing our subtraction to additive plastic impacts we measure our transition.</p>

					<br>

					<p>Afterall, how can we tell if we‚Äôre tranisitioning from plastic if we don‚Äôt know how much we‚Äôre generating in the first place? </p>
					<p>Only once we know how much plastic we‚Äôre consuming each month and year and we meaningful work to reduce it.</p><br>

					<p>Once we‚Äôve assessed our grey impacts, we can focus on increasing our green.    By tracking our plastic sequestration activities we can mindfully increase our subtractive plastic impact.  This is the basis of the Plastic Transition Score.</p>

					<p>A household score is calculated with several factors:  Your plastic monthly generation and your household ecobricking and household offseting.  These are measured month by month over the course of a year.</p><br>

					<p>GoBrik uses a per capita algorythm to compare your household to your country‚Äôs per capita average. Estimate how you compare to others in your country and GoBrik does the rest using per reviewed scientific data.</p>
					
                    <p>
					Alternatively, you can manually track and disclose your plastic generation yourself.  Many ecobrickers do this with a two basket system.  Over the course of the month, the plastic that they consume they clean, dry and put in a Weighing basket.  At the end of the month, they weigh this plastic, and move it to their Ecobricking Basket.  From this basket they grab the plastic for their ecobricks.  Meanwhile, they begin the month anew filling the Weighing Basket with their consumption.  As the month goes by, they also pay attention to the plastic they give away to others or use outside their home (produced plastic).</p>

					<p>Each month, GoBrik then calculates the net amount of plastic you‚Äôve consumed so far this year.</p>
					
					<p>GoBrik then compares this to the net weight of a user‚Äôs authenticated ecobricks made in that year as well as any offsetting that the user has done.  A similar process is used for companies in the GEA Catalyst program.  Your green impacts are divided by your grey impacts for the year so far.</p>

					<p>The resulting Plastic Transition Score is then calculated as a percentage of zero waste.</p>

					<p>In otherwords, if you‚Äôre generating and ecobricking exactly the same amounts of plastic, then your score is 100 (i.e. 100% of zero waste).  A PTR below 100 shows your household is still putting plastic into the biosphere.  A score above 100 means you are removing plastic from the biosphere.</p>

					<p>Begining by ecobricking staff plastic consumption, an enterprise can spark the work of reducing its plastic generation.  Enterprises can then work with their local communities to catalyze further ecobricking.  The ecobricking that comes from such catalyzation is a green impact that the Global Ecobrick Alliance attributes as a green offset to companies.  Enterprises can also purchase plastic offset credits, which through the Brikcoin blockchain, directly correspond to authenticated plastic sequestration.</p>

                    <p>Tracking plastic transition is an essential key performance indicator for businesses serious about going green and transforming their negative impact on the biosphere to a positive one.  The GEA Catalyst program and our GoBrik tracking software  is designed to empower enterprises to this purpose.</p>
