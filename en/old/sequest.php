                                <h5>The goal of plastic sequestration is to follow the Earth's example of carbon care in preventing the degradation despersal of plastic into the biosphere— and in keeping it out of industry.</h5>   
                                <br>

                        <div id="preclosed1">
                        
                        <p>Just as the Earth sequestered carbon deep into secure geologic storage to cultivate and green the biosphere, so too can we compact, secure, and sequester our plastic (which itself is mostly carbon). By following the <a href="/plastic">Earth’s example</a> we can be confident our enterprise of plastic management is making a valuable ecological contribution.</p>

                        <p>We call this prevention of plastic degradation and despersal, <i>plastic sequestration.</i></p>

                        <p>Plastic degradation occurs physically (such as cracking, embrittlement, and flaking) and chemically (such as leaching).  Emissions and dispersal occur when plastic is industrially processed through recycling, incineration and land-filling.  In order to prevent these outcomes, plastic sequestration diverts plastic from industry and prevents the chemical and physical degration of plastic from the effects of light, heat, acids, friction, microbial action etc.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><b>1. Preventing Degradation</b><p>
                            <p>Plastic polymer degradation occurs on the exposed surface are of plastic.  Consequently, the rate of degradation is directly proportional to the amount of surface area exposed. Research indicates that that a thin film of HDPE plastic (which has a very large surface area) can degrade 1100 times faster than a bead of plastic of the same weight (very small surface area). </p>
                            <p>By decreasing net surface area, the lifetime of collected plastic can be extended significantly (research shows thin film of plastic will <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b06635" target="_blank">degrade in 1.8 ± 0.4 years a bead of plastic will endure for 2000 ± 400 years</a>, in the same conditions.  By further removing exposure to all forms of chemical and physical degration through appropriate applications, plastic can remain intact indefinitely.</p>

                            <br><p><b>2. Preventing Industrial Emissions</b><p>
                            
                            <p>Plastic that enters into industry results in a wide range of energy intensive activities from transportation, to smelting, to re-molding. The 2019 report, Plastic & Climate: The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet concluded that  the CO2 produced at various points in the life-cycle of plastic and concluded that the plastic industry will add more than 850 million metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere—equal to the emissions from 189 five- hundred-megawatt coal power plants.</p>
                            
                            <p>The goal of plastic sequestration is to prevent these emissions.</p>
                                
                            <br><p><b>3. Preventing Industrial Plastic Dispersion</b></p>
                            <p>Plastic that enters into industry is inevitably dispersed around the globe.  Research shows that of all the plastic generated since 1950, the industrial processing of plastic has dispersed <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782">91% of all plastic into the biosphere</a>. There it is subject to the chemical and physical degradation pathways mentioned above.</p>
                            
                            <p>The goal of plastic sequestration is to prevent this dispersion.</p>

                            <br><p><b>4. Preventing Ecological Disruption</b></p>
                            <p>Plastic once loose in the biosphere has been shown to interfere with ecological cycles.  This can impede the ability of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22554-w">phytoplankton to circulate oxygen</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/microplastics-killing-fish-before-they-reach-reproductive-age-study-finds">disrupt fish reproduction</a>, and more.</p>
                            <p>The goal of plastic sequestration is to prevents these disruptions.</p>

                            <br><p><b>5. Earthen Enclosure</b><p>

                            <p>Research has shown that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391013003066?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">enclosing plastic in earth</a> prevents abiotic plastic degradation by preventing exposure to sunlight, friction, heat, and oxygen. Even plastic that is designed to degrade, when it is buried in low-oxygen soil, abiotic and biotic are <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b06984" target="_blank">prevented</a>. Research also shows that submerging plastic in inert soil (minimal bacteria, micro-organisms) <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4985426" target="_blank">can further significantly impede biotic plastic degradation.</a></p>
                            <p>By enclosing the outputs of plastic sequestration in inert, net-zero earthen building materials such as cob and adobe, the outputs of plastic sequestration can be secured.</p>

                            <p>Industrial plastic plastic management methods are typically linear.  Plastic recycling, incineration and landfilling spirals plastic towards dispersion.  Industrial methods are powered by fossil fuels that are decompacted and burned, loosening their carbon into the atmosphere.</p>

                            <p>In comparison, the Earth has used carbon in circular, cyclical processes.  Carbon molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and glycans make up all organisms– and when one organism comes to an end, another begins by building itself with the other’s blocks.  This continues indefinitely, until the carbon is subsumed into long-term sequestration.</p><br>

                            <br><p><b>Plastic Sequestration Standards</b><p>
                            <p>To be considered sequestered, plastic sequestration outputs must be demonstrably reusable.  Their application must prevent abiotic and biotic degradation, reducing  specific surface degradation rate (SSDR) of the plastic to below 0.1 μm year–1.</p>

                        <p> According to CIEL's 2019 report <a href="https://www.ciel.org/plasticandclimate/" target="_blank">Plastic & Climate: The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet</a> the production and incineration of plastic will add more than 850 million metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere—equal to the emissions from 189 five- hundred-megawatt coal power plants. At present rates, these greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic lifecycle threaten the ability of the global community to meet carbon emissions targets.</p>


                        <br><p><b>Preventing Industrial Emissions & Dispersion</b><p>
                        <p>Plastic that enters into industry results in a wide range of energy intensive activities from transportation, to smelting, to re-molding.  On average globally, each metric ton of plastic processed by recycling, land-filing and incineration <a href="coefficients.php#co2">generates 689kg, 65Kg and 2967kg of CO2e respectively</a>.  This can be prevented by plastic sequestration. Given that on average globally 18% of plastics are recycled, 24% are incinerated and the remaining 58% are landfilled or directly reach the envioronment, preventing the industrial processing of plastic avoids 0.88Kg of CO2 per Kg of plastic.</p>
                        <p>Plastic sequestration also prevents the embedded carbon of the plastic from dispersing loose into the biosphere.  The Global Ecobrick Alliance estimates that this prevents <a href="aes">3.1Kg of carbon per 1kg of plastic</a> from the chemical and biotic degradation of plastic over time.</p>

                        <!--<br><p><b>Accelerating Plastic Transtion</b><p>
                        <p>All plastic disposal methods, result in the production of replacement plastic.  Once plastic is used and dispose, more must be made to replace the product or packaging that was just consumed.  Within traditional industrial disposal of plastic for every 1kg of plastic disposed, 0.91kg of plastic can be estimated to replace it.  In other words, industrial disposal has a 91% replacement rate.  Each replacement cycle results in the carbon emissions of the virgin plastic produced to replace it, the emissions of its disposal, replacement, disposal and so on, echoing through time until the original amount has been fully subsumed.</p>
                        <p>In comparison, various plastic sequestration methodes result in different replacement rates.  The research of the Global Ecobrick Alliance estimates that a regular ecobrick has a replacement rate of 61%, cigbricks have a 75% replacement rate, and ocean ecobricks of 80%.  These methods still result in the production of virgin plastic, but not as much as before-- and without the carbon emissions of dispoal.</p>
                        <p>Using the replacement rate of a particular method of plastic sequestration, the equivalent amount of carbon emissions prevented from industrial processing can be calculated for each kilogram of plastic that is authenticated as sequestered.</p>-->

                            <p>By following the criteria of plastic sequestration we are putting our plastic on a safe road through time that avoids the pittfalls of degradation and industry.  Because plastic can last for so long, its important to plan far into the future and put plastic on a safe and secure road through time.</p>
                            
                            <p>However, it is in important to remember that in the cyclical systems of the biosphere, there’s never such thing as ‘final’.</p>
                                
                            <p>Ecological cycles can be very short, long and very long.   The Earth’s sequestration is an example of the latter– measured in hundreds of millions of years.   By sequestering our carbon/plastic into long-term storage we’re putting it into another cycle.  In the way that plastic was a gift to our age, we can gift our carbon to another. </p>
