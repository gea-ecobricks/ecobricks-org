						<p>Every day thousands of tons of plastic flow into the biosphere. Meanwhile, the consumption of plastic and its production ever increases.  In order to be a deep solution to plastic, a regenerative solution must spread at a rate faster than industrial expansion rates.  In order to maximize spread, adoption and collective plastic transition we strive to maximize the accessibility of our methods while minimizing the barriers to adoption. In this way, we empower others to make and build with ecobricks so that they can lead by their own example.</p>

						</div>
					</div>

    			<p><ul>
					<li><b>Localized:</b> By designing with local, organic or upcycled materials (that are ideally freely available) we remove resource barriers to replication.</li>

    				<li><b>Petro-Capital Transition:</b> By designing methods that do not require machines, we remove the barrier of technology, specific skills and dependence on petroleum based energy.


    			<li><b>Transcaste:</b> By designing our methods so that they do not require specialized abilities we remove age, gender and geographical barriers to replication and empowerment.</li>
   				 
				<li><b>Open Source:</b> By making our designs open source according to creative commons specifications and easily accessible on the web, we energize and accelerate replication.
    			
				<li><b>Non-Capital:</b>  By designing methods and using materials that do not require capital, we remove the financial barrier to participation and replication.  </li>

				<li><b>Local:</b>  We strive to employ locally available resources in our ecobrick applications.  First and foremost, ecobricking is all about packing our local plastic.  This begins with the very plastic we have personally consumed, then extends to that consumed in our household and community. Ideally we use PET bottles that come from our community and a stick that comes from our area.  This way we transform plastic that would otherwise cause problems in our area with the minimum amount of energy and the maximum amount of social empowerment.</li>

				<li><b>Cyclically Designed:</b>  Ecobricks and all their applicatins are designed for indefinite cycles that are enriching ecologically and socially.</li>

			</ul>

				<p>When it comes to building with ecobricks, the same principal of localized sourcing applies.  We strive to use local materials, processes, skills and culture for our creations.  For example, we have developed the ecobrick tube banding method of bonding ecobricks to make use of the abundance of free and ‚Äòwaste‚Äô motorcycle inner-tubes in South East Asia.  In the UK we learn from ancient earth building traditions of wattle and daub to combine ecobricks using local clay, straw and sand.</p>

				<p>By using materials, goods, services and products that come from within our community and region we likewise minimize our dependence on capital and petroleum.</p>

						<p>In our case, it is our common intention of keeping plastic out of the biosphere.  By holding a mission that is to the benefit of individuals, people, communities and the planet, the GEA enables this formidable force to power the realization of its vision.</p>

						<p>This principle is in contrast to the means by which capital economy motivates and inspires participation through financial remuneration.  As a non-capital technology, ecobricking taps a deeper, more potent values such as community cleanliness, the health of children, the richness of the local ecology, to inspire participation, action and long term vision commitment.</p>

						<p>For example, these very words are translated into other languages‚Äì not because we have paid anyone‚Äì but because they are in full resonance with the ecological passion of others who, resonating with our mission and vision, have offered their linguistic and programming expertise to make this happen.</p>

			<div class="page-paragraph">    
			
			<p>It can be helpful to better understand what we mean by regenerative by clarifying what it is now.  Ecobricking is often mistaken a ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô technology.  ‚ÄòSustainability‚Äô  tends to refer to the virtue of enabling our current human systems and current way of life to continue.  Here, guided by the Earthen principles above, ecobricking technology is <i>not this</i>.  Instead, as regenerative technology, we strive to transition from sustaining the current human systems that deplete ecosystems to ways of living that enrich.</p>

			<p>In this way, our principles are not anti-industry, nor anti-petro-capital.  Without them, we would not have come to the principles we now hold.  We acknowledge that yesterday‚Äôs use of Earth gifted carbon has been an important formative phase that sets us on our current course-correction.</p>
			
			<div class="row">
                
                    <div class="main2">

			<p>With this we move on from 'sustaining'.  In so far as our modern enterprises work in ways that conflicts with Earth‚Äôs example of carbon care, we strive to transition from them.  We also strive to heal and ‚Äòregenerate‚Äô any past damage that we are responsible for.  Finally, in contrast to the sustainability‚Äôs focus on minimizing grey impacts, instead we strive in the ayyew spirit of syncing with Earth‚Äôs cycles to ever increase our green impacts.</p>
