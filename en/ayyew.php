                <p data-lang-id="004-lead-page-paragraph">The Asian ecobrick movement emerged from the land of the Igorot people and is deeply inspired by their ancestral ecological ethos.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="page-paragraph">

                <p data-lang-id="005-first-page-paragraph">The Igorots, one of the few unconquered indigenous people of South East Asia, have thrived for centuries in the mountains of Northern Luzon in the West Philippines Sea. While over the last 300 years, Spanish, Japanese and Americans colonized the Philippines archipelago, they were unable to dominate the various Igorot tribes that lived in the fertile valleys of the mountainous region.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="006-page-paragraph">It was in the land of the Igorot people that in 2011, <a href="/story">the Asian ecobrick movement was ignited</a>. It started as a resistance movement <a href="https://www.ecobricks.org/reports-of-ecobrick-making-flood-in-from-across-mt-province/">of Igorot communities</a> to the plastic of American, Swiss and Filipino companies attempting to distribute their packaged food products in Igorot traditional territory.  However, it soon spread to the rest of the Igorot region, to the next door provinces and throughout the Philippines.  And beyond!<p>

                <p data-lang-id="007-page-paragraph">The outsized global inspiration of the Igorots can only be understood in the light of their remarkable cycle-centered culture.</p>

                <h4 data-lang-id="009-ayyew-title">An ancient ecological ethos for our modern moment</h4>

                <p data-lang-id="010-page-paragraph">Like many other indigenous peoples around the world, <a href="https://medium.com/earthen/1000-years-pollution-free-d8ddb70a703f" target="_blank">the concept of waste does not exist</a> in the Igorot language prior to the arrival of colonists.  All materials and objects in Igorot use had its own cycles of various phases of use.  The cycles of life, of matter, and of the seasons were so important to the Igorots, that their culture was centered upon them.  To this day, <a href="https://book.earthen.io/en/kincentric">cyclocentric Igorot society</a> continues to thrive-- their fields and forest being some of the most verdant and biodiverse in South East Asia, while their innovations (like ecobricking) have inspired tens of millions of folks around the world.</p>.

                <p data-lang-id="011-page-paragraph">Underlying Igorot cyclocentric culture is their concept of <i>ayyew</i>— a term that has no corollary in latin languages or western philosophy.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="012-page-paragraph">As one of the chief virtues of the Igorot people, the concept of Ayyew guides the Igorot way of life.   In Igorot culture, Ayyew is as important and as lauded as other virtues such as Courage, Honor or Loyalty..</p>

                <p data-lang-id="013-page-paragraph">When Igorots refer to a person or process being "ayyew" they are referring to how well that person is in sync with the cycles of life around them.  When someone is ayyew, it means that they are harmonizing with ecological cycles.  If someone is not ayyew, well, that means they are jamming things up and causing trouble!</p>

                <p style="margin-left:15px; margin-top:20px; border-left:2px solid var(--text-color);padding-left:10px;"><i data-lang-id="014-ta-quotation">All aspects of Igorot life and culture are guided by the virtue of ayyew. Men, women, households and communities are admired and respected to the degree in which they embody the principle. Ayyew means to not just to be in sync with a cycle, but to tend to its spin.</i></p>
                <p style="font-size:small;text-align:right;margin-top:-8px;margin-bottom:30px;" data-lang-id="015-ta-quotation-caption">
                    — Banayan & Maier, <a href="https://book.earthen.io/en/spirals.html">Tractatus Ayyew, Cycles that Spiral</a></p>

                <p data-lang-id="016-page-para">In other words, being ayyew refers to the cyclical contribution a person is adding to a particular cycle.  In this way, a person, household or community is admired and respected to the degree in which they are enriching the cycles of life of which they are part.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="017-page-para">One of the best examples of ayyew is dealing with food left-overs.  Igorot villages are almost completely self-sustaining-- with almost all their food grown in the valleys around them.  Consequently, there are various ways to manage left-overs from a meal (burned rice, vegetable cuttings, husks and shells, etc.).  Each method, represents a varying level of ayyew...</p>

                <p data-lang-id="018-page-para">Throwing food leftovers randomly away would not be consider ayyew-- as it causes a mess! Composting food leftovers would be ayyew as it contibutes to the garden that provided the food in the first place. However, even more ayyew would be to feed the leftovers to the family pigs or chickers, who would both grow fat and provide even richer fertilizer for the garden.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="019-page-para">The way that land is managed provides another example of Ayyew...</p>

                <p data-lang-id="020-page-para">A farmer who turns a barren hillside into a cabbage field is being ayyew.  In doing so, he has added several new species to the space and is generating sustenance for themselves and the community.  A farmer who turns a cabbage field into a rice padding is also being ayyew.  In doing so, water is captured and pooled to grow not just rice, but provide home for snails, frogs, mudfish and more.  A forester, who plants a paddy with fruit trees is also being ayyew.  In doing so sustenance is provided for not just humans, but birds and bugs of all kinds as the canopy of the trees provides even more net volume for life to make its home and live in cycles.  Finally, those who provide and overseeing the forestation of an orchard are also being ayyew (or simply protecting a forest)-- for what has more cycles of life than a forest?</p>

                <p data-lang-id="021-page-para">In this way, being ayyew is not a state of being, but a process of being.  However, it is a directional process, one that leads to ever more abundance from ever more sync with the surrounding cycles of life.  Consequently, being ayyew, can include very low-level and simple shifts, as one ascends the steps of ecological synchrony and enrichment.</p>

                <h4 data-lang-id="023-ayyew-plastic-title">An Ayyew View of Plastic</h4>


                <p data-lang-id="024-page-para">Ayyew is the virtue of striving to be in ever more harmony with the surrounding ecological cycles.  Ayyew is not a state of being, but a process of being.  However, it is a directional process, one that leads to ever more abundance from ever more sync with the surrounding cycles of life.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="025-page-para">Ayyew is a virtue or a “good thing” for Igorots, something that is good for individuals, households and community to strive for.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="026-page-para">Because Ayyew is not a state but rather a process, it is non-judgemental of one’s present ecological state.  In this way, an industrial farmer with a giant mono-crop could be also be Ayyew!  Assuming they’re making a shift that is: switching from mono-cropping to polycropping, ditching pesticides, moving on from chemical fertilizer, etc.  While these are simple shifts, in so far as they moving in the direction of alignment with ecological cycles, they are being ayyew.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="027-page-para">This non-judgemental perspective, has important implications for the way Igorots manage their plastic.  From an Ayyew perspective the plastic that passes through their hands each day is not bad in and of itself.   Rather, it is a material that reflects our collective moment in time and which has its own unique properties.  Properties that can be put to use in different ways that either enrich or deplete ecological cycles.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="028-page-para">Consequently, from the Ayyew perspective, in the Igorot language, there was never a word for “waste” or “trash”.  From the ayyew perspective, nothing is innately useless.  Instead, every material presents an opportunity that can be embraced– or not.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="029-page-para">Like plastic!</p>

                <p data-lang-id="030-page-para">From this ayyew perspective, ecobricking arose in Igorot village.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="031-page-para">Rather than burning or dumping plastic (where it contaminates rivers and fields) more ayyew was to keep plastic in its solid state.  Rather than send plastic bottles off to be recycle or dumped somewhere else, far more ayyew was to put it to use locally in its solid state.  From this perspective, it was a short leap to packing and securing plastic into PET bottles-- and then in the stone building Igorot tradition, put these "bottle bricks" to use to build gardens and walls.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="032-page-para">Of course, it's possible to strive and sync even better with the surrounding ecological cycles.  An ayyew ecobricker strives to move from modules to gardens to <a href = "earth.php">earth and ecobrick</a> green space structures that <a href = "sequest.php">sequester plastic</a> and CO2.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="033-page-para">Inspired by this deep and powerful Igorot concept, the Global Ecobrick Alliance has developed our principles, techniques and applications around the concept of Ayyew. Ayyew fits in closely with regenerative philosophy and guided our development of the <a href = "https://www.ecobricks.org/principles">regenerative guiding principles</a>. that underlie the work of the <a href = "about.php">Global Ecobrick Alliance</a> and the <a href = "movement.php">global ecobrick movement</a>.</p>


                <h3 data-lang-id="034-guiding-title">A Guiding Green Principle</h3>


                <p data-lang-id="035-page-para">We believe the concept of ayyew has great relevance for us in the ecological downturn of the 21st century as we strive to solve ecological challenges.  Moving on from linear, black and white judgements, we can shift instead to acceptance.  And from there, steadily increase our alignment and synchrony with ecological cycles.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="036-page-para">Ecobricking is just one modern manifestation of the Ayyew concept.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="037-page-para">Building on the concept of Ayyew, the co-founders of the Igorot ecobrick movement have gone on to develop a theory of what green should really mean.  Their <i>Tractatus Ayyew</i> lays out a theory or Earthen ethics using plastic as an example for how ayyew can help us solve our modern ecological challenges.</p>
