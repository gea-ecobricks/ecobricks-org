		<p data-lang-id="005-first-page-paragraph">The Igorots, one of the few unconquered indigenous people of the South East Asia, have thrived in ecological harmony for centuries in the remote mountains of the Northern Philippines. Like many other indigenous peoples around the world, the concept of waste does not exist in their language— and consequently in the world around them. Instead their culture was guided by a virtue and concept known as ‘Ayyew’.

    <p data-lang-id="059-regenerative-definition">Phenomena such as ‘pollution’, ‘poverty’ and ‘exploitation’ also did not exist in their world prior to the arrival of Spanish and American empiralists. Never  dominated by Spanish, Japanese or American colonialists, their fierce and wise ‘Ayyew’ culture directly inspires and guides the ecobrick movement sweeping the globe. We consciously adapt the term to summarize and qualify the principles of the ecobrick movement. We feel it fills a pressing linguistic gap and helps us articulate our way forward.</p>

    <p data-lang-id="060-principles-acknowledgement">In this way, our principles are not anti-industry, nor anti-petro-capital. Without them, we would not have come to the principles we now hold. We acknowledge that yesterday’s use of Earth gifted carbon has been an important formative phase that sets us on our current course-correction.</p>

        <div class="main2">
            <p data-lang-id="061-moving-on-from-sustaining">With this, we move on from 'sustaining'. Insofar as our modern enterprises work in ways that conflict with Earth’s example of carbon care, we strive to transition from them. We also strive to heal and ‘regenerate’ any past damage that we are responsible for. Finally, in contrast to the sustainability’s focus on minimizing grey impacts, instead we strive in the ayyew spirit of syncing with Earth’s cycles to ever increase our green impacts.</p>
