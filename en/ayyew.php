            <div class="page-paragraph">

            <p data-lang-id="005-first-page-paragraph">The Igorots, one of the few unconquered indigenous people of the South East Asia, have thrived for centuries in the remote mountains of Northern Luzon in the West Philippines Sea. While Spanish, Japanese and Americans colonized the remainder of the Philippines archipelago, they struggled in vain to dominate the various Igorot tribes that lived in the fertile valleys of the mountainous region.  However, lone explorers and anthropologists who reached the region were made welcome.  It was here that in 2011, the Asian ecobrick movement was ignited as a means of transformative resistance to deal with the innundation of plastic from American, Swiss and Filipino companies attempting to distribute their packaged food products in Igorot traditional territory.<p>

 <p data-lang-id="006-second-page-paragraph">Like many other indigenous peoples around the world, the concept of waste does not exist in the Igorot language prior to the arrival of colonists.  All materials and objects in Igorot use had its own cycles of various phases of use.  The cycles of life, of matter, and of the seasons were so important to the Igorots, that their culture was centered upon them.  To this day, cyclocentric Igorot culture continues to thrive-- their fields and forest being some of the most verdant and biodiverse in South East Asia, while their innovations (like ecobricking) have inspired tens of millions.</p>.

                <h4 data-lang-id="058-ayyew-title">An ancient ecological ethos for our modern moment</h4>


                <p>Underlying Igorot cyclocentric culture is their concept of <i>ayyew</i>-- a term that has no corollary in latin languages or western philosophy.   When Igorots refer to a person or process being "ayyew" they are referring to the harmony by which it is in synk with an ecological cycle.  Specifically, the contribution that the person or the process is making to enrich that cycle.  In Igorot society, a person, household or community is admired and respected to the degree in which they embody the principle.</p>


                <p data-lang-id="061-daily-igorot-description">An example of ayyew in daily Igorot life is dealing with food left-overs.  Composting food leftovers to grow a garden would be more ayyew than just throwing it away. However, even more ayyew would be to feed the food leftovers to the pigs, who would both grow fat and provide even richer fertilizer for the garden.</p>

                <p>In this way, Ayyew means to not just to be in sync with a cycle, but to tend to its spin.  Consequently, being ayyew can involve ever ascending heights of ecological synchrony and enrichment.</p>

                <p>For example, a farmer who turns a barren hillside into a cabbage field is being ayyew.  In doing so, he has added several new species to the space and is generating sustenance for themselves and the community.  A farmer who turns a cabbage field into a rice padding is also being ayyew.  In doing so, water is captured and pooled to grow not just rice, but provide home for snails, frogs, mudfish and more.  A forester, who plants a paddy with fruit trees is also being ayyew.  In doing so sustenance is provided for not just humans, but birds and bugs of all kinds as the canopy of the trees provides even more net volume for life to make its home and live in cycles.  Finally, those who provide and overseeing the forestation of an orchard are also being ayyew (or simply protecting a forest)-- for what has more cycles of life than a forest?</p>

                <p data-lang-id="060-chief-virtue-description">As one of the chief virtues of the Igorot people, the concept of Ayyew guides the Igorot way of life.   In Igorot culture, Ayyew is as important and as lauded as other virtues such as Courage, Honor or Loyalty.  When someone is ayyew, it means that they are striving towards ever-increasing harmony with the cycles of life.

                <p data-lang-id="059-regenerative-definition"> We consciously adapt the term to summarize and qualify the principles of the ecobrick movement. We feel it fills a pressing linguistic gap and helps us articulate our way forward.</p>



                <h4 data-lang-id="058-ayyew-title">Ayyew Guides Our Ecobricking</h4>


                <p data-lang-id="062-direct-equivalent-description">Ayyew is the virtue of striving to be in ever more harmony with the surrounding ecological cycles.  Ayyew is not a state of being, but a process of being.  However, it is a directional process, one that leads to ever more abundance from ever more sync with the surrounding cycles of life.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="063-good-thing-description">Ayyew is a virtue or a “good thing” for Igorots, something that is good for individuals, households and community to strive for. In the same way as individual voices in a choir merge to attain otherwise impossible harmonies, their lives are integrated with the cycles of other species to achieve otherwise impossible health and abundance.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="064-non-judgemental-description">Because Ayyew is not a state but rather a process, it is non-judgemental of one’s present ecological state.  In this way, an industrial farmer with a giant mono-crop could be also be Ayyew (assuming they’ve shifted from striving from profit, to striving for ecological harmony.)</p>

                <p data-lang-id="065-perspective-plastic-description">Likewise, from an Ayyew perspective plastic is not bad in and of itself.   It is a material with certain properties and characteristics that can be put to use in different ways.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="066-language-description">Interestingly enough, in the Igorot language, there was never a word for “waste” or “trash”*.  From the ayyew perspective, nothing is innately useless.  Instead, every material presents an opportunity that can be embraced– or not.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="067-concept-description">The concept of ayyew thus has great relevance for us in the ecological downturn of the 21st century as we strive to solve ecological challenges.  Moving on from linear, black and white judgements, we can shift to sinking with cycles.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="068-modern-manifestation-description">Ecobricking is a modern manifestation of the Ayyew concept with regard to our personal plastic.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="069-ecobricking-one-description">For example, ecobricking one’s plastic is more Ayyew than recycling it: ecobricking puts the plastic to immediate local use whereas industrial recycling, involving transportation and far factories, is a longer more energy consuming process.</p>

                <p data-lang-id="070-ecobrick-alliance-description">The Global Ecobrick Alliance’s development of ecobrick applications further reflects our aspiration to the virtue of Ayyew. Our first innovation for building modules with ecobricks was to use silicone. However, silicone requires some (minimal) capital, and relies on non-local materials (the silicone and gun) and requires a specialized skill (using the caulking gun).</p>

                <p data-lang-id="071-motorcycle-description">The latest innovation for using ecobricks uses old motorcycle inner tubes– which syncs with the local cycle of consumed and disposed tires, using them to everyone’s advantage. This is what the Igorots would call ‘nagagut‘ (“being industrious”, or “reflecting of Ayyew”).</p>

                <p data-lang-id="072-strive-and-sync-description">Of course, it's possible to strive and sync even better with the surrounding ecological cycles.  An ayyew ecobricker strives to move from modules to gardens to <a href = "earth.php">earth and ecobrick</a> green space structures that <a href = "sequest.php">sequester plastic</a> and CO2.

                <p data-lang-id="073-deep-and-powerful-description">Inspired by this deep and powerful Igorot concept, the Global Ecobrick Alliance has developed our principles, techniques and applications around the concept of Ayyew. Ayyew fits in closely with regenerative philosophy and guided our development of the <a href = "https://www.ecobricks.org/principles">regenerative guiding principles</a>. that underlie the work of the <a href = "about.php">Global Ecobrick Alliance</a> and the <a href = "/movement">global ecobrick movement</a>.</p>
