                <p data-lang-id="005-first-page-paragraph">The Global Ecobrick Alliance recommends the use of earth and ecobricks to build non-structural, non-load bearing green spaces such as benches, planters, and food forest play parks.  By using simple methods to build small-scale inspiring constructions that fully embody regenerative principles, we enable others to copy our constructions.  As more and more ecobrickers lead and assist in earth building, more and more plastic is sequestered.  And as more and more people get their hands dirty building with earth, more and more we reconnect to the earth and... Earth!</p>

                <p>Earthen building with ecobricks is a key step in our individual and collective journeys of plastic transition.</p>

		<p data-lang-id="006-first-page-paragraph">Our recommended GEA earth building methods are designed to be both adaptable and scalable. Ecobrick and earth building is fundamentally about working with what resources are locally available– so we encourage you to adapt accordingly to your local context. We encourage you to start by learning from ancestral earth building methods in your region and starting small.  By starting small, you and your community can master methods and principles that apply equally to large projects as they do small. Once we have mastered small non-structural applications, we fully envisions homes and structures built with earth and ecobricks.</p>

                    <p>The Global Ecobrick Alliance recommends building small scale green spaces that serve your local community.  This means that you can enlist the help of your neighbours to not only get the ecobricks you need, but to help you build.  Small builds of two to three layers embody can easily embody all the principles of earth and ecobrick building and plastic sequestration and make full use of the unique properties of ecobricks for building.</p>

                    <p>Horizontally laid ecobricks are ideal for creating curving garden benches/raised-beds where we can sit, play and eat.   In particular we recommend design spaces that can be gardened with edible plants (fruit trees, berries, herbs, etc.).   Given that most of the plastic we stuff into our ecobricks comes from food packaging, building gardens that grow real food, is pretty apt!  </p>

                    <p>Because Ecobrick and earth building methods are non-capital and replicable, students and youth groups can take full charge of a project– from making the ecobricks, to designing the space, to building and gardening.  This creates a sense of pride and ownership that is greatly empowering.   Best of all, the earth and ecobrick technique you will learn is indefinitely scalable– these are the same fundamentals used to construct houses and buildings.</p>

                    <p>Done properly, benches can be stood on and used to play tag.  Done poorly, well…  a bench does not have the same risks considerations as a wall or structure.  Ecobrick green spaces are a great educactional launch into earth building.</p>

                    <p>Making an Earth Module is a super simple way to become acquainted with all the steps of earth and ecobrick building.</p>

                    <p>A great way to learn the basics of earth and ecobrick building is to put together your own earth module.  Earth modules, only use a few ecobricks, yet apply all the steps of the GEA recommended methods.  Each of the steps below references one of the more detailed building steps found on this page.</p>

                    <p data-lang-id="052-block-5-paragraph-1">This is part of the circular design principle of ecobricking: we're thinking about the next use of the ecobrick. When your ecobrick is put to use in a module or an earth construction, the bottom color will help make patterns and designs.</p>

                    <p data-lang-id="053-block-5-paragraph-2">To create your ecobrick's bottom color, choose a soft plastic with a solid color, then push it down to the bottom of your ecobrick. You'll want to fill the bottle loosely about halfway with soft plastic of your chosen color. Then, pack it in with your stick. If your bottle has "legs" or dimples at the bottom, be sure to pack these solid and full. Once all your soft plastic is compressed, you want it to fill the first 1-2cms of the bottle.</p>

                    <p data-lang-id="054-block-5-paragraph-3">Often schools or companies will ask their ecobrickers to make ecobricks with their community colors. By giving your ecobrick bottom a color, you open up colorful design possibilities for making modules or earth and ecobrick walls.</p>

                    <p data-lang-id="058-block-6-paragraph-1">The smaller the pieces, the denser you'll get! Fill the bottle up halfway with loose plastic, then use your stick to push down around the sides of the bottle. Keep pushing down as you move around the circumference of the bottle. Once compressed, add more loose plastics. To maximize the density, it's good to mix soft, then hard plastic. If it's your first ecobrick, weigh occasionally to make sure you are on track for your target minimum weight.</p>

                    <p data-lang-id="059-block-6-paragraph-2">Did you push too hard? In rare cases, when using a sharp stick, a thin bottle or too much lateral force, an ecobrick will rupture. If so, start again. Ruptured bottles will not last and can leak plastics. Cut the bottle open, remove the plastic and start again. Cut or damaged PET plastic is readily recycled.</p>

The GEA has determined that an ecobrick's density must be higher than <strong>0.33 g/ml</strong>. This means that a 600ml bottle must be above 200 grams and a 1500ml bottle must be above a weight of 500 grams. Experienced ecobrickers tend to regard 0.37 g/ml and above as the range of good ecobricks.</p>

                    <p data-lang-id="066-block-7-paragraph-2">We've discovered that obligating minimum density in your community's ecobricking is essential to ensure quality ecobricks. Quality ecobricks ensure solid and safe constructions and maximize the bottle's volume for securing plastic out of the environment.</p>

                    <p data-lang-id="067-block-7-paragraph-3">Ecobricks that are below 0.33 g/ml are too squishy to be used for modules and are not ideal for earth building. Soft ecobricks can compromise structural constructions and will dent easily, which reduces their lifespan. Low-density ecobricks are also <a href="/fire">fire hazards</a> because of the air pockets remaining inside them.</p>

                    <p data-lang-id="068-block-7-paragraph-4">That said, a good solid ecobrick that meets all GEA guidelines is something you can be proud of and which will inspire others! An ecobrick's heft and quality set an inspiring example for others and energize the social spread of ecobricks. When others see and hold your ecobrick, they will understand immediately that something important has happened: "waste" has been transformed into something fundamentally useful.</p>

                            <p data-lang-id="070-block-7-advanced-paragraph">Some advanced ecobrickers are so industrious at chopping up their plastic and packing their bottles that their ecobricks are too dense! When these ecobricks are used to make modules, the weight of the ecobricks can be too much for the silicone bonds to hold. Also, such modules are too heavy to be safely moved by children or older people. For these reasons, the GEA recommends keeping your density below 0.7 g/ml.</p>
