				<p data-lang-id="004-lead-page-paragraph">The Global Ecobrick Alliance has developed best-practices  for building with earth and ecobricks.  Our methods are designed to ensure the long-term sequestration of plastic in solid and safe constructions that can be built by anyone anywhere.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="page-paragraph-reg">
				<p data-lang-id="005-first-page-paragraph">The Global Ecobrick Alliance recommends the use of earth and ecobricks to build non-structural, non-load bearing green spaces such as benches, planters, and food forest play parks.  By using simple methods to build small-scale inspiring constructions that fully embody regenerative principles, we enable others to copy our constructions.  As more and more ecobrickers lead and assist in earth building, more and more plastic is sequestered.  And as more and more people get their hands dirty building with earth, more and more we reconnect to the earth and... Earth!</p>
				<p data-lang-id="007-first-page-paragraph">Earthen building with ecobricks is a key step in our individual and collective journeys of plastic transition.</p>
				<p data-lang-id="008-first-page-paragraph">Our recommended GEA earth building methods are designed to be both adaptable and scalable. Ecobrick and earth building is fundamentally about working with what resources are locally available– so we encourage you to adapt accordingly to your local context. We encourage you to start by learning from ancestral earth building methods in your region and starting small.  By starting small, you and your community can master methods and principles that apply equally to large projects as they do small. Once we have mastered small non-structural applications, we fully envisions homes and structures built with earth and ecobricks.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="018-block-2-paragraph-1">The Global Ecobrick Alliance recommends building small scale green spaces that serve your local community.  This means that you can enlist the help of your neighbours to not only get the ecobricks you need, but to help you build.  Small builds of two to three layers embody can easily embody all the principles of earth and ecobrick building and plastic sequestration and make full use of the unique properties of ecobricks for building.</p>
						<p data-lang-id="019-block-2-paragraph-2">Horizontally laid ecobricks are ideal for creating curving garden benches/raised-beds where we can sit, play and eat.   In particular we recommend design spaces that can be gardened with edible plants (fruit trees, berries, herbs, etc.).   Given that most of the plastic we stuff into our ecobricks comes from food packaging, building gardens that grow real food, is pretty apt!  </p>
						<p data-lang-id="020-block-2-paragraph-3">Because Ecobrick and earth building methods are non-capital and replicable, students and youth groups can take full charge of a project– from making the ecobricks, to designing the space, to building and gardening.  This creates a sense of pride and ownership that is greatly empowering.   Best of all, the earth and ecobrick technique you will learn is indefinitely scalable– these are the same fundamentals used to construct houses and buildings.</p>
						<p data-lang-id="021-block-2-paragraph-4">Done properly, benches can be stood on and used to play tag.  Done poorly, well…  a bench does not have the same risks considerations as a wall or structure.  Ecobrick green spaces are a great educactional launch into earth building.</p>

						<h4 data-lang_id= 057-block-5-header-1>Earth is different everywhere on Earth!  Before we get started, we get to know our local earth.</h4>
						<p data-lang_id= 058-block-5-paragrah-1>The first step is to test the earth that you will use for your construction.  Choose a soil near your building site with a high clay content, no stone, and no silt (decayed organic material). Ideally your earth sticks together nicely and can be formed into a ball that holds together.</p>
						<p data-lang_id= 059-block-5-paragrah-2>Of course, soil is different everywhere!  A soil’s character comes from the different amounts of sand, clay and silt in it.   If there’s too much clay in the earth, it will crack when it dries.  If there’s too much sand it will crumble when it dries.  If there’s do much silt, it won’t hold together nor be maleable like we need it to be.  We can however adjust our local soil to be better for building by adding more sand to it.  To do this, we  want to figure out the best combination of sand and earth to make your final building material– what we call ‘cob’.</p>
						<p data-lang_id= 060-block-5-paragrah-3>With your chosen earth, make some cob pancakes!  It’s just like baking with dirt when you were a kid, but more scientific!  Mix small batches of cob with varying ratios of your local sand and clay.   Make pancakes of about 3cm by 15cm.  Try different rations, like one part sand, two parts clay.  Lay out a mix of different rations (i.e.  1:0, 0:1, 1:3, 1:1, 3:1) on a board.   Let them dry in the sun and out of the rain.  Note that for this testing, we don’t yet add any organic binder (i.e. straw, hay) as we are solely focused on testing the earth.  The binder comes later and will add strength to the final cob.</p>
						<p data-lang_id= 061-block-5-paragrah-4>After two or three days, when the samples are fully dry, review your pancakes.  Break them carefully feeling how they hold up under pressure.</p>
						<p data-lang_id= 062-block-5-paragrah-5>Based on your review you are now able to make an educated decision on the ratio to use for your project’s cob!  Choose the ratio that does not crumble easily, nor which hasn’t cracked.  Of course, you’ll also want to factor in things like the transportation and cost of the sand or the cost.  Some cracking (especially for the interior of non-structural benches) is not a big deal– and remember, the binder we add will add strength.</p>
						<p data-lang_id= 063-block-5-paragrah-6>Once you have chosen your ideal ratio of sand and earth and have found an organic binder you’re ready to make cob!</p>
						<p data-lang_id= 064-block-5-paragrah-7>Its time to prepare your materials….</p>

						<p data-lang-id="126-block-12-paragraph-1">This is where the earlier layout of your work site pathways is key (Step 3).  Have your cob mashing team move to mash on another tarp, while you ball-making team takes over.  Once the balls are ready, they are brought to the team compacting them onto the build.</p>
						<p data-lang-id="127-block-12-paragraph-2">Bang the cob balls around the ecobricks that are set in the cement.  Pack the cob all the way down between bottles.  It can be helpful to lay small stones between the bottles to take up space and minimize the use of cob.</p>
						<p data-lang-id="128-block-12-paragraph-3">Make sure that 2cm of the bottom and top of the ecobricks are exposed on the inside and outside of your bench.  Later, this space will be filled with your finishing skin-layer of cob.</p>
						<p data-lang-id="129-block-12-paragraph-4">Cover the ecobricks with a layer of compacted cob approximately 5cm high.  Bang your new ecobricks down as you lay this level.  Aim for 4cm of distance between the ecobricks below. Keep your horizontal spacing consistent at 4 cm between bottles.  Position each new ecobrick in between the two below it.</p>

						<p data-lang-id="131-block-13-paragraph-1">Once the bottles are snug in the lower cob layer, fill in any large gaps between bottles (i.e. on curves) with stones.  This will help your cob mixture go further.  Fill in with cob between the bottles.  Add another layer of 5cm on top of the bottles.  Bang your new ecobricks down as you lay this level.  Aim for 4cm of distance between the ecobricks below.</p>
						<p data-lang-id="132-block-13-paragraph-2">Keep adding layers of bottles and cob!  We find that benches are good with two or three layers of bottles.  For walls, add a row of iron re-bar at every 5th layer of bottles.</p>
