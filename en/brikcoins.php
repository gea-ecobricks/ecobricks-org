        <h4 data-lang-id="032-step1-title">Step 1: Ecobricking</h4>
        <p data-lang-id="033-step1-description">The brikcoin manual-blockchain revolves around the ecobricking of used plastic.  <a href="what">Ecobricking</a> is an established means of securing plastic. It is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process that is most effectively done manually.  If done <a href="/how">properly</a> an ecobrick can be used for long-term <a href="build">building applications</a>; ensuring that its plastic is secured from industrial processing and release into the biosphere.</p>
        <p data-lang-id="034-step1-log-ecobrick">Once complete, ecobrickers log their ecobrick on the <a href="/gobrik">GoBrik</a> platform.  A serial number is given by the system and the ecobricker enscribes this permanently on the ecobrick. A photo of the ecobrick with the serial number is taken and the logging completed.</p>
        <p data-lang-id="035-step1-queue-review">The logged ecobrick is then automatically queued for review.  The ecobricker is awarded credits that allow them to validate other ecobricks that have been logged.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4 data-lang-id="036-step2-title">Step 2: Validation</h4>
        <p data-lang-id="037-step2-standards">The GEA has defined standards for an ecobrick. Only when a packed bottle meets these standards is it considered an ecobrick, and only then is the plastic it contains considered sequestered.</p> 
        <p data-lang-id="038-step2-validation-process">Using one validation credit, ecobrickers are entitled to validate one ecobrick from the queue. The validator proceeds through a three-step process of reviewing the ecobrick, to ensure that it meets the criteria and standards of plastic sequestration. In total, each ecobrick is reviewed by three validators in the community.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4 data-lang-id="039-step3-title">Step 3: Authentication</h4>
        <p data-lang-id="040-step3-authentication-algorithm">An algorithm calculates a validation score based on the review. The three validation scores are averaged and if the average exceeds the minimum threshold, the ecobrick is authenticated. Brikcoins are then generated and issued to the validators and the <a href="https://gobrik.com/#cr">GoBrik Central Reserve</a> based on the weight of the ecobrick.</p>
        <p data-lang-id="041-step3-brikcoin-generation">The amount of Brikcoins generated is a function of the weight of the authenticated ecobricked plastic.  This 'plastic standard' is pegged to a ratio of 1 BRK (ß) to 100g of AES plastic. For example, a 322g ecobrick will generate 3.22 ß, while a 0.41 kg ecobrick will generate 4.10 ß.  As the blockchain operates however, this valuation fluctuates.  See the live <a href="brikchain.php">Brikchain Explorer</a> for the latest valuation.</p>
