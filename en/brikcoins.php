			<p>More than just numbers in ledger, every brikcoin correlates directly with plastic that has been secured from from polluting the biosphere— and permanently removed from high-emissions industries. In the same way that ancient gold and silver coins have a value in and of themselves, Brikcoins are based on the ecological value that they represent.</p>

                		<p>Two billion years ago, Earth's atmosphere was full of carbon dioxide.  The planet's climate was unstable and its surface barren.  However, steadily the atmosphere's CO2 was cycled into carbon-based life, which, generation after fallen generation, was buried and secured into the ground.  As more and more <a href="/plastic">carbon ended up sequestered</a>, there was less and less CO2 in the atmosphere.  Steadily the climate stabilized and Earth's biosphere blossomed.</p>

						<p>Today, our petroleum based plastic comes directly from these ancient underground carbon stores.  As a form of carbon, what we do with our plastic can be of ecological benefit— <i>or not</i>.</p>

						<p>When plastic is dumped, it degrades into dangerous micro-plastics.  When plastic is incinerated it returns to the atmosphere as CO2.  And when plastic that is processed by industry it causes factories to spin and churn, resulting in more emissions and more plastic products.</p>
						
						<p>However, by following Earth's example of securing, concentrating and sequestring our cabon we can keep our plastic out of the biosphere and out of industry.  This work has important ecological value in so far as it avoids pollution, desperses benefit and supports biodiversity.</p>
						
						<p>This process of <a href="sequest">plastic sequestration</a> is defined as a manual, net-zero, non-industrial process (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_sequestration" target="_blnak">wikipedia page</a>).  In order to be sequestered, the resulting secured-plastic must meet the criteria of plastic sequestration to ensure that it is in fact green.</p> 

						<p>One of the most universal and accessible means of plastic sequestration is <a href="what.php">ecobricking</a>.</p>
						
						<p>Ecobricked plastic, <i>if it has been authenticated to have met the criteria of plastic sequestration</i>, embodies an ecological and utility value.  This value can be quantified by the weight of the plastic sequestered within it.</p>

						<p>Brikcoins are based on the ecological value of <a href="/aes">Authenticated Ecobrick Sequestered plastic (AES plastic)</a>.</p>

					<p><b>Step 1: Ecobricking</b></p>

					<p>The brikcoin "blockchain" revolves around the ecobricking of used plastic.  <a href="what">Ecobricking</a> is an established means of securing plastic. It is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process that is most effectively done manually.  If done <a href="/how">properly</a> an ecobrick can be used for long-term <a href="build">building applications</a>; ensuring that its plastic is secured from industrial processing and release into the biosphere.</p>

					<p>Once complete, ecobrickers log their ecobrick on the <a href="/gobrik">GoBrik</a> platform.  A serial number is given by the system and the ecobrickers enscribes this permanently on the ecobrick. A photo of the ecobrick with the serial number is taken and the logging completed.<p>
					
					<p>The logged ecobrick is then automatically queued for review.  The ecobricker is awarded credits that allow them to validate other ecobricks that have been logged.</p>

					<br><br>
					<p><b>Step 2: Validation</b></p>

					<p>The GEA has defined standards for an ecobrick. Only when a packed bottle meets these standards is it considered an ecobrick, and only then is the plastic it contains considered sequestered.</p> 

					<p>Using one validation credit, ecobrickers are entitled to validate one ecobrick from the queue. The validator proceeds through a three step process of reviewing ecobrick, to ensure that it meets the criteria and standards of plastic sequestration. In total, each ecobrick is reviewed by three validators in the community.</p>
					
					<br><br>
					<p><b>Step 3: Authentication</b></p>

					<p>An algorithm calculates a validation score based on the review. The three validation scores are averaged and if the average exceeds the minimum threshold, the ecobrick is authenticated. Brikcoins are then generated and issued to the validators and the <a href="https://gobrik.com/#cr">GoBrik Central Reserve</a> based on the weight of the ecobrick.</p>

					<p>The amount of Brikcoins generated is a function of the weight of the authenticated ecobricked plastic.  This 'plastic standard' is pegged to a ratio of 1 BRK (ß) to 100g of AES plastic. For example, a 322g ecobrick will generate 3.22 ß, while a 0.41 kg ecobrick will generate 4.10 ß.  As the blockchain operates however, this valuation fluctuates.  See the live <a href="brikchain.php">Brikchain Explorer</a> for the latest valuation.</p>
